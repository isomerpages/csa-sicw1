**Building a Cohesive Global Cybersecurity Architecture - Interconnectivity, Interoperability and International Cyber Diplomacy**

Strengthening the global cybersecurity architecture is a team sport. Both public and private stakeholders have a role to play in developing an open, secure, stable, interoperable, accessible and peaceful ICT environment. A cohesive approach will reduce risks to international peace and security, and secure economic and social development. How can a multistakeholder approach support a rules-based international order in cyberspace, especially in a dynamic cyber threat landscape?

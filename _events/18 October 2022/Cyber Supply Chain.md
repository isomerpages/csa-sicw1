#### **Cyber Supply Chain**

**18 October 2022 (Tuesday)**  
*2.00pm to 4.00pm (GMT +8)*

*Format: Physical*

Cyber supply chain risks are complex and of global concern. Cyber supply chains represent one of the most challenging areas for organisations to secure as vulnerabilities can be introduced at any point in the supply chain activities. Individual efforts by organisations to manage cyber supply chain risks are also insufficient to address the systemic risks from increased digitalisation and cyberattacks.  
 
The Cyber Supply Chain Programme is a national effort that aims to mitigate cyber supply chain risks and uplift the cyber resilience of Singaporeâ€™s essential services through five foundational initiatives. 

This SICW Cyber Supply Chain brings together stakeholders to take a whole of ecosystem approach on what governments, business owners and vendors can do to discuss this complex problem in need of an enhanced and collaborative outcome.

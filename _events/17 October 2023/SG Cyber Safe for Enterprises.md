#### **SG Cyber Safe for Enterprises**

**17 October 2023 (Tuesday)**  
*Time TBC (GMT +8)*

Organisations have accelerated their pace of digitalisation, and with a corresponding increase in attack surface, cybersecurity is a critical enabler for organisations. As organisations adopt cloud computing, it is important for organisations to have the know-how to operate in a secure cloud computing environment. Join us in this event to learn about CSA’s latest initiatives to help organisations stay “cyber safe” in the cloud. 

Given that cybersecurity is a collective responsibility, this event also recognises organisations partnering with CSA to enable a Safer Cyberspace for Enterprises and have made outstanding contributions to CSA’s SG Cyber Safe programme.

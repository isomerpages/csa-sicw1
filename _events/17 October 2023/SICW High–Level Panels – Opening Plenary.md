**Navigating Tech Bifurcation: The Age of Walls and Bridges**
<br>There is an increasing perception that the digital and cyber domain is becoming increasingly splintered into ideological camps, leading to efforts to limit technological cooperation to only trusted partners. However, this goes against the idea of an interconnected and interoperable world. Is technological leadership a zero-sum game and can we devise a way forward that benefits all? This session explores the diverse perspectives towards the navigation of a fraying digital era.

**Ally or Adversary? Defining the Relationship and Roles of Big Tech and Government in the Cyberspace**
Big Tech has significantly changed the way we live. Whether to gain access to information on any subject, connect and transact remotely, or even, more recently, outsource our work to Artificial Intelligence, billions of people around the today heavily rely on Big Tech's products and services. While Big Tech offer great opportunities in terms of innovation and technology developments, these come with potentially greater threats – the spread of misinformation, invasion of data and privacy, and Artificial Intelligence are being used to spread malware and exploit vulnerabilities. Against this backdrop, what can we do to ensure that the technologies and resources that Big Tech hold are harnessed for good? What should be the Government's role in ensuring this? What part does Big Tech itself play? This session explores the relationship and roles of Big Tech and Government in Cyberspace.

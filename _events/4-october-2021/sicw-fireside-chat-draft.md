**4 October 2021 (Monday)**  
*8pm to 9.30pm*

*Format: Virtual*

The Fireside Chat will set the stage for the rest of the events at SICW 2021 by kicking off a lively session on the intricacies of digital adjacencies, and strategies to advance cyber stability and resilience, as well as augment the potentials of public-private partnerships.

Digital transformation, brought forth by new technologies and accelerated by COVID-19, has changed the operating landscape for countries and societies across the world. Global connectivity and interdependency have increased our reliance on shared digital infrastructure, tools and applications, the entanglement of businesses and supply chain, as well as the ease of social connections. These developments bring along new and enhanced risks on national security, unequal economic development, business continuity and social resilience. What then, does this mean, to the stakeholders of the digital future? How can we traverse the digital terrain for a more prosperous, secure and safer world? Join our esteemed panellists for an exciting conversation on the macro-trends of technology, how these trends are causing shifts in global power dynamics, and how nations and corporations can collaborate to navigate the risks and challenges together.

The Fireside Chat will be held virtually on 4 October 2021.

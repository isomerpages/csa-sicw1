#### **High-Level Panel: Trust and Security in the Quantum Era**

**16 October 2023 (Wednesday)**  
*Time: 2.00pm to 4.30pm (GMT +8)*

In the Quantum era, with the advent of quantum computing comes quantum risks which threaten to undermine the cryptographic foundations upon which digital trust is built, prompting the necessary re-examination of the way digital trust is secured and changes to cryptography and keys used.

The theme for this High-Level Panel Tech event for Quantum is **Trust and Security in the Quantum Era**, and it will consist of two segments:

**Segment I: Securing Trust amidst Quantum Risks**
This aims to stimulate a discussion to explore the current state of and the implications of quantum computing on digital security and trust, and. It will also seek to address the challenges of building awareness and providing suitable advisories for quantum-safe solutions in light of the emerging quantum threat.

**Segment II: Key Changes towards Quantum Safety** 
This aims to explore the quantum-safe solutions aimed at mitigating these threats and how assurance in these new solutions can be built.  The adoption and integrating these solutions will be discussed in the context of how the journey towards quantum-safety can be charted and what are the key actions and changes needed in this migration to maintain digital resiliency and secure digital assets in this Quantum era.

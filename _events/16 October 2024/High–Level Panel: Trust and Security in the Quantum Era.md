#### **High-Level Panel: Trust and Security in the Quantum Era**

**16 October 2024 (Wednesday)**  
*Time: 2.00pm to 4.30pm (GMT +8)*

In the Quantum era, with the advent of quantum computing comes quantum risks which threaten to undermine the cryptographic foundations upon which digital trust is built, prompting the necessary re-examination of the way digital trust is secured and changes to cryptography and keys used.

The theme for this High-Level Panel Tech event for Quantum is **Trust and Security in the Quantum Era**, and it will consist of two segments:

**Segment I: Securing Trust amidst Quantum Risks**
This dialogue explores the current state of and the impact of quantum computing on digital security and trust. It also aims to address the challenges of raising awareness, providing appropriate advisories for quantum-safe solutions; and identifying opportunities for international collaboration amongst governments and industry.

**Segment II: Key Changes towards Quantum Safety** 
This panel aims to explore quantum-safe solutions designed to mitigate quantum risk, and establish assurance in these new solutions. Delving into the technical challenges of adopting and integrating these solutions, the discussion will pivot towards charting a path to
develop and operationalise agile quantum-safe solutions and strategies, ensuring digital resiliency and safeguarding digital assets against the quantum threat.

**Bridging the Capacity Gap on AI and Cybercrime: Empowering Stakeholders for a Secure Digital Southeast Asia**

Southeast Asia stands at a critical juncture, grappling with the rapid expansion of digital technologies while simultaneously facing a growing threat landscape. The GFCE Southeast Asia Regional meeting aims to address this pressing challenge by fostering a robust dialogue on building regional cybersecurity capacity and exploring the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in combating cybercrime.

Aligned with the GFCE's overarching goal, this gathering prioritizes capacity building at all levels. By focusing on the unique needs and challenges of Southeast Asia, the event seeks to strengthen the region's cybersecurity defenses collectively. Moreover, the integration of AI into the cybersecurity discourse underscores its potential as a powerful tool in the fight against cybercrime. Through open and collaborative discussions, participants will explore innovative strategies and solutions to fortify the region's digital infrastructure and protect its citizens from emerging cyber threats.

The event will bring together ASEAN member states and other stakeholders in the region, in person in Singapore, to reflect on the evolution of the cybercrime landscape in the region and the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in combating cybercrime and bridging the existing workforce capacity gap. The meeting will also serve to engage with regional stakeholders on activities of the SEA GFCE regional hub.

The half-day regional meeting will take place at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre in Singapore and back-to-back with the Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW). Participants must register for the SICW to attend the GFCE Southeast Asia Regional Meeting. There will be opportunities for attendees to connect with ASEAN member states and regional stakeholders, who are part of the broader Southeast Asia ecosystem as well as of the GFCE community.

We look forward to welcoming the GFCE Southeast Asia community to Singapore for this yearly gathering!

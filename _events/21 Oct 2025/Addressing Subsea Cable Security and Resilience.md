#### **Addressing Subsea Cable Security and Resilience**

**21 October 2025 (Tuesday)**  
*Time: 2.00pm to 3.00pm (GMT +8)*

The resiliency of subsea cable infrastructure is gaining greater attention among policymakers. In September, 24 countries signed the New York Joint Statement on the Security and Resilience of Undersea Cables, a non-binding effort to secure global subsea infrastructure through increased supply chain and data security measures.

Despite this momentum, a common understanding of the policies needed to address these risks, and an internationally-coordinated strategy to implement them, are lacking in comparison to other areas of security policy. 

This panel will convene senior government and industry leaders to discuss the threat landscape for subsea cable infrastructure and outline a set of tangible recommendations for government and industry to implement to enhance the protection, recovery, resilience and governance of subsea cable infrastructure.

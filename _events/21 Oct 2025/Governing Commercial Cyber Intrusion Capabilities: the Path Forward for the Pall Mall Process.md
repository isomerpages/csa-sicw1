#### **Governing Commercial Cyber Intrusion Capabilities: the Path Forward for the Pall Mall Process**

**21 October 2025 (Tuesday)**  
*Time: 4.30pm to 5.30pm (GMT +8)*
<br>*Venue: SICW C*

In today’s global cyber threat landscape, the rapidly-growing market enabling the development, facilitation, purchase, and use of commercial cyber intrusion capabilities (CCICs) and the potential irresponsible use of these technologies raise questions and concerns over their impact on national security, human rights and fundamental freedoms, international peace and security, and a free, open, peaceful, stable, and secure cyberspace. Addressing this growing challenge, the Pall Mall Process is an international, multi-stakeholder initiative seeking to establish guiding principles and highlight policy options for States, industry and civil society in relation to this issue. This roundtable will coalesce leading voices to engage on a discussion on the state of the threat, the actions to take at national, regional, and international stages and the future efforts of the Pall Mall Process to develop industry standards for responsible behaviour in the development, facilitation, purchase, transfer and use of CCICs. Reflecting the Pall Mall Process’ inclusive format, the session will be open to all stakeholders participating in the Singapore International Cyber.

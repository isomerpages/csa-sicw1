#### **High-Level Panel: Policy**

**21 October 2025 (Tuesday)**  
*Time: 1.00pm to 3.00pm (GMT +8)*

*Format: Closed Door Event*

When everything is critical, who protects it? What do cyber norms actually tell us to do? And how, and by whom?

Dependence on digital infrastructures is continuously increasing, from energy grids to healthcare systems, making them an ever more attractive target for malicious cyber operations. As these risks intensify, the urgency grows to move beyond political declarations toward meaningful, coordinated action. 

States have endorsed the UN framework for responsible State behaviour in cyberspace – including norms and CBMs that call for the protection of critical infrastructure. Regional organisations such as the OSCE and ASEAN have agreed to similar CBMs. But who implements these norms and CBMs? Who ensures they are upheld not only by governments, but also by the operators, engineers, developers, and researchers behind the world’s most essential systems?

This session presents the [Geneva Manual on Responsible Behaviour in Cyberspace](https://genevadialogue.ch/geneva-manual/) exploring the evolving roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders in implementing cyber norms and confidence-building measures for critical infrastructure protection. It draws on the [Geneva Manual](https://genevadialogue.ch/geneva-manual/)’s latest chapter, which translates high-level commitments into practical guidance for action in today’s complex threat environment.

Through a multistakeholder interactive conversation, the session will highlight challenges, share emerging good practices, and examine how diplomatic agreements are being interpreted, operationalised, and embedded into real-world decisions.

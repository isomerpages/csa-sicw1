In 2025, the theme for the SG Cyber Safe for Enterprises event will be “Growing with Cyber Essentials and Cyber Trust” and is a celebration of how cybersecurity fuels business growth and trust.  Organisations that attain Cyber Essentials and/or Cyber Trust grow by strengthening their digital foundations, earning greater customer confidence and market opportunities.

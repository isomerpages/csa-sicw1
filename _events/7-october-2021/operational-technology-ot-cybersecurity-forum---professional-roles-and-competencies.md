#### **Operational Technology (OT) Cybersecurity Forum – Professional Roles and Competencies**

**7 October 2021 (Thursday)**  
*9.00am – 12.00pm*

*Format: Virtual*

The forum will bring together industry leaders, OT cybersecurity practitioners, educators and human resource partners to discuss the need to develop talents with the relevant skillsets in the emerging OT cybersecurity field.  CSA, together with Mercer, will share the OT Cybersecurity Competency Framework (OTCCF) which was recently developed in consultation with stakeholders in the industry and the Government.  The OTCCF will help:

a.	**Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) operators** to identify skillsets and training for their engineers;  
b.	**Training providers** to develop best-in-class courses and certifications catering to local training needs; and  
c.	**OT cybersecurity professionals** to chart a career pathway and enhance their knowledge and skills through the various roles in this field.

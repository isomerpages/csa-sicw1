Disruptions have taken centre stage as key factors in just about every facet of the human condition. In technology, healthcare, communications, travel, even social norms and modes of behaviour, the recent past has seen unprecedented pace and impact of change in our lives. Growing and adapting to meet the emerging challenges, and identifying developing opportunities, are key to establishing resilient and successful communities of the future.

With the support of the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) and community partners across the region, GovWare Conference promises a stellar line-up of programmes as we address this year’s theme "Living with COVID-19 - Reimagining Digital Security Risks and Opportunities”.

“Governments & Tech MNCs: Regulate or Collaborate for Cybersecurity?”

Today, established tech companies own and operate a large segment of the digital infrastructure used by critical information infrastructure owners, governments, enterprises, and citizens. Tech MNCs are at the forefront of tech development and there are much that governments can learn from tech MNCs about emerging tech domains and their implications on cybersecurity. Global cybersecurity incidents, such as the Microsoft Exchange Server security breach, have shown that the impact tech MNCs have on cybersecurity is non-trivial. Neither governments nor the tech MNCs have all the answers to cybersecurity issues. Instead, better government-tech MNCs cooperation on cybersecurity issues is needed.

This session will explore the opportunities, benefits, dilemmas, and trade-offs in the engagements between governments and tech MNCs on cybersecurity risk management. The panellists will speak about how governments and tech MNCs can address existing gaps in cybersecurity cooperation between both sides and progress towards a trusting two-way relationship.

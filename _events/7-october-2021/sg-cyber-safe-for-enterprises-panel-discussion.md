There has been a worrying trend of increasing ransomware attacks on both large and small organisations around the world. While these organisations grapple with the onslaught of ransomware attacks, ransomware actors have continued to evolve and advance, developing more sophisticated malware that evades traditional antivirus solutions.

Join us in the SG Cyber Safe for Enterprises Panel Discussion to learn about the business risks and legal implications of ransomware attacks, and how enterprises can put in place safeguards to protect their businesses.

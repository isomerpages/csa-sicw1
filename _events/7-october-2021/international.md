*3pm – 5pm*

*Format: Virtual*

The International IoT Security Roundtable (IIoTSR) serves as a platform to galvanise international efforts to address IoT security, a pressing issue given the rapid proliferation and pervasiveness of such devices. From the inaugural event in 2016, this platform has been instrumental in seeding international collaborations, leading to the launch of Singapore’s Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme last year. This year the IIoTSR will also bring together cyber chiefs, standards leaders and industry perspective, for a Leadership Dialogue on “internationalising IoT standards & certification towards building a trusted secure IoT ecosystem”.

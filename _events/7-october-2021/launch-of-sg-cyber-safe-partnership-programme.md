#### **Launch of SG Cyber Safe Partnership Programme**

**7 October 2021 (Thursday)**  
*10.30am to 11.00am (GMT +8)*

*Format: Virtual*

While the Government takes a key role in leading cybersecurity efforts, cybersecurity is also everyoneâ€™s business and thus, a collective responsibility. For this reason, CSA is working closely with industry to co-develop cybersecurity content or products that complement our efforts to drive cybersecurity awareness and adoption.

The SG Cyber Safe Partnership Programme encourages industry to partner with CSA to raise the cybersecurity posture of local businesses, individuals and the community.

Join us in the launch of the SG Cyber Safe Partnership Programme, where we will unveil early partners on board the programme and introduce some of the initiatives jointly developed by CSA and industry partners.

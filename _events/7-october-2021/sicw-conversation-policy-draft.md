#### **SICW Conversation (Policy)**

**7 October 2021 (Thursday)**  
*9.45pm to 10.45pm*

*Format: Virtual*

Today, established tech companies, otherwise known as “digital giants”, own and operate a large segment of the digital infrastructure used by critical information infrastructure owners, governments, enterprises, and citizens. Digital giants are at the forefront of tech development and there are much that governments can learn from digital giants about emerging tech domains and their implications on cybersecurity. Global cybersecurity incidents, such as the SolarWinds incident, have shown that the impact digital giants have on cybersecurity is non-trivial. Neither governments nor the digital giants have all the answers to cybersecurity issues. Instead, better government-digital giants cooperation on cybersecurity issues is needed. 

This session will explore the opportunities, benefits, dilemmas, and trade-offs in the engagements between governments and digital giants on cybersecurity risk management. The panellists will speak about how governments and digital giants can address existing gaps in cybersecurity cooperation between both sides and progress towards a trusting two-way relationship.

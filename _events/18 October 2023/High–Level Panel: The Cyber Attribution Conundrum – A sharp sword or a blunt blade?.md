#### **High-Level Panel: The Cyber Attribution&nbsp;Conundrum - *A sharp&nbsp;sword or a blunt&nbsp;blade?***

**18 October 2023 (Wednesday)**  
*Time: 4.00pm - 5.10pm (GMT +8)*

Cyber attacks are often considered to be too complex to accurately attribute. This is especially so when States are accused of conducting or supporting malicious cyber activities, concerns over the credibility, accuracy and intent of cyber attribution are often hotly debated. Has attribution been effective, or has it just been a one way street? The capability to determine the perpetrator with verifiable evidence remains elusive. Even then, how can an act by patriots, be distinguished from State sponsored activity? What are the suite of actions that States can take in attribution? What capacities are needed for States developing a policy in attribution?

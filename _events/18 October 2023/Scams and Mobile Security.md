#### **Scams and Mobile Security**

**18 October 2023 (Wednesday)**  
*Time: 2.00pm to 6.00pm (GMT +8)*

Apps are becoming the most popular way for users to conduct online transactions, communicate with friends and family, and even perform their work activities. It is therefore imperative to ensure that devices are trustworthy, safe and secure, against phishing threats and scams. This requires strong collaboration between app developers, operating system owners, device manufacturers, and policy makers â€“ to ensure that the right policies, tools, and programmes are put in place, across the ecosystem.

This event will invite government agencies, industry leaders like Google, app developers, associations, and other ecosystem partners to share their perspectives on how we can better keep users and their data safe on mobile platforms. It will also feature a panel discussion on how different players can cooperate and collaborate to address the risk of scams and other threats to cybersecurity.

#### **SG Cyber Safe for Enterprises Dialogue – The Human Factor: The Achilles’ Heel in Digital Security**
 
**20 October 2022 (Thursday)**  
*10.30am – 11.30am (GMT +8)*

*Format: Physical (by invitation only) + Livestreaming*

Employees tend to be the weakest link in an organisation’s security, as attackers continually evolve and advance the sophistication of social engineering attacks. For this reason, the human factor remains a critical issue in creating a secure digital environment. 

Join us in the SG Cyber Safe for Enterprises Dialogue to understand more about the human factor in your organisations and how you can take steps to address the weakness.

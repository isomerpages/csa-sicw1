#### **SICW Conversations (Technology)**

**20 October 2022 (Thursday)**  
*1.00pm – 2.00pm (GMT +8)*

*Format: Hybrid*

Recent geopolitical developments have highlighted the outlook of an increasingly fragmented global Internet system. This has raised the risks of the Internet developing into “splinternets”, where instead of a single global Internet, there could be a multitude of regional and national Internet-like networks that are isolated from one another and potentially using incompatible technologies. Should these splinternets come to exist, the lack of communication between these different splinternets will result in a divided world and could pose new cybersecurity challenges and risks. 

The goal of the session is to stimulate a vibrant discussion on how the public and private sectors can collaborate to address the potential challenges and mitigate the risks posed by a fragmented Internet. 
 
Dr Olaf Kolkman, Principal, Internet Society, will touch on these topics during his presentation. The presentation will provide insights on the factors contributing to the fragmentation of the Internet, the paradigm shifts required to patch it and various international efforts to stem the development of splinternets, amidst rising geopolitical tensions and proliferation of disinformation.

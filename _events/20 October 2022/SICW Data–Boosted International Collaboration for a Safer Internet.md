#### **Data-Boosted International Collaboration for a Safer Internet**

**20 October 2022 (Thursday)**  
*4.30pm – 5.30pm (GMT +8)*

*Format: Hybrid*

This one-hour session will explore the value of international collaboration and data-sharing initiatives in the fight against systemic cyber risk. Moderated by Leslie Daigle, CTO at the Global Cyber Alliance (GCA), the session will be divided in two parts— a round of institutional presentations from CSA Singapore and the GCA (whose joint project on IoT is now turning one year) and a roundtable with two European experts on IoT and data-boosted collaboration, from NASK (Poland’s national CERT) and TU Delft (the Netherland’s largest research institution on Safety and Security).

#### **SICW Sessions: Internet or Splinternet – Implications on Securing the Digital Future**

**20 October 2022 (Thursday)**  
*1.00pm – 2.00pm (GMT +8)*

*Format: Hybrid - Sands Expo & Convention Centre, MBS Lvl 5 (limited seating) + SICW Virtual Platform*

 Recent geopolitical developments have highlighted the outlook of an increasingly fragmented global Internet system. This has raised the risks of the Internet developing into “splinternets”, where instead of a single global Internet, there could be a multitude of regional and national Internet-like networks that are isolated from one another and potentially using incompatible technologies. Should these splinternets come to exist, the lack of communication between these different splinternets will result in a divided world and could have implications on securing our digital future. 

This session aims to stimulate discussion on how the public and private sectors can collaborate to address the potential challenges and mitigate the risks posed by a fragmented Internet. It will touch on the fragmentation of the Internet and how to shape the future of the Internet.

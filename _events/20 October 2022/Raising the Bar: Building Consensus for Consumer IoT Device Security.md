#### **Raising the Bar: Building Consensus for Consumer IoT Device Security**
 
**20 October 2022 (Thursday)**  
*3.30pm – 4.30pm (GMT +8)*

*Format: Hybrid*

This session will aim to help manufacturers of connected consumer “internet of things” (IoT) devices adopt critical capabilities to improve security in their products. Earlier this year, the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, a coalition of technology companies, joined with consumer advocates via Consumers International, and security researchers via I Am The Cavalry, to launch a joint statement on the five most important security capabilities for consumer IoT devices – no universal default passwords, implementation of a vulnerability disclosure policy, updated software, secure data, and secure communications. 

During this workshop, an expert panel featuring industry representatives, subject matter experts, and government regulators will discuss the importance of these capabilities and share insights and guidance to support adoption and implementation by manufacturers to raise the baseline security of consumer IoT devices. The event will also serve to launch a new online resource hub by the Cybersecurity Tech Accord featuring implementation examples and access to resources and materials to support manufacturers to improve IoT device security.

#### **Raising the Bar: Building Consensus for Consumer IoT Device Security**
 
**20 October 2022 (Thursday)**  
*3.00pm – 4.00pm (GMT +8)*

*Format: Hybrid*

This session will aim to help manufacturers of connected consumer “internet of things” (IoT) devices adopt critical capabilities to improve security in their products. Earlier his year, the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, a coalition of technology companies, joined with consumer advocates via Consumers International, and security researchers via I Am The Cavalry, to launch a joint statement on the five most important security capabilities for consumer IoT devices – no universal default passwords, implementation of a vulnerability disclosure policy, updated software, secure data, and secure communications. During this workshop at Singapore International Cyber Week, an expert panel featuring industry representatives, consumer advocates, security researchers and government regulators will discuss the importance of these capabilities and share insights and guidance to support their widespread adoption and implementation by manufacturers to raise the baseline security of all consumer IoT devices. The event will also serve to launch a new online resource hub by the Cybersecurity Tech Accord that provides implementation examples and access to resources and materials to support manufacturers to improve IoT device security.

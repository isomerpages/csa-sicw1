#### **Whose responsibility? Indo-Pacific Perspectives on Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace**

**17 October 2024 (Thursday)**  
*Time: 9.00am to 11.00am (GMT +8)*

*Format: Closed Door Event*

For nearly 20 years, the discussion on responsibility in cyberspace has been predominantly associated with the UN Group of Governmental Experts and the UN Open-Ended Working Group on ICT security. Both processes have produced a corpus of rules, principles and norms that represent consensus opinion among the UN member states. Despite these achievements, a lot of questions have remained unanswered. This is partly due to the fact that the mandate of the UN groups is limited to the responsibility of states and to issues of cyber that affect international peace and security.
This situation obfuscates further exploration of how different countries perceive ‘responsibility’ nationally and what other dimensions need to be considered. In addition to international law and norms, how have countries – for instance – introduced ‘responsibility’ when it established and mandated cyber roles for operational and executive agencies such as police, military and intelligence? We also lack insights into how various countries and stakeholder groups consider ‘good practice’ in cyber governance.

With that in mind, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) are organising a workshop on Indo-Pacific perspectives on responsible state behaviour in cyberspace to unpack some of these questions. 

This is an invite-only workshop and spaces are limited. Please write to [Sara Seppanen](mailto:SaraS@rusi.org) to register your interest and we will contact you if additional spaces are made available.

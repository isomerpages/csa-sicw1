#### **High-Level Panel: When the Next Disruption Strikes, Who is Responsible for Digital Resilience?**

**17 October 2024 (Thursday)**  
*Time: 11.00am to 12.00pm (GMT +8)*

Large-scale digital disruptions that occur instantaneously with no advance warning can often erode public confidence in the digital domain, threatening to stall the progress and undermine the potential of digitalisation. Given the complex and interconnected nature of the digital ecosystem, such disruptions are bound to happen, and are perhaps even unavoidable. It is not a question of if, but when the next disruption could occur. 

If there is anything to be learnt from the recent **Crowdstrike**-related disruptions, it is that resilience – the ability to recover quickly and effectively from a disruption – is key. 

Without resilience, it becomes difficult to have trust in our digital ecosystem. Digitalisation will inevitably falter, if people start doubting or even avoiding digital technologies. Ensuring a resilient and trusted digital environment is not just a technical challenge, and there remain questions over who is responsible for digital resilience and how do different stakeholders work together. 

This session will discuss the strategic and policy implications of resilience in the digital domain, and the possible next steps we can take to strengthen resilience in the digital domain. Join our panel of government experts and industry leaders as they discuss the roles and responsibilities of the public and private sectors in strengthening resilience in the digital domain, and how public-private partnerships can contribute to this important effort.

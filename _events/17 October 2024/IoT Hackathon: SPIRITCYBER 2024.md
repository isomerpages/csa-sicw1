Project Omega is a national threat analytics initiative which collects and studies novel IoT exploitation attacks to generate awareness of IoT threats relevant to the government’s Smart Nation initiatives. The conduct of annual IoT Hackathon - “SPIRITCYBER” is part of the project deliverables to meet this objective. SPIRITCYBER is a 3-series hackathon which started from 2022 and aims to discover new IoT attack techniques through crowdsourced wisdom from the larger cybersecurity community. The hosting of the annual SPIRITCYBER hackathon event during SICW also serves to foster collaboration with industry and academia. The theme for this year SPIRITCYBER-24 is “Cybersecure Urban Living”

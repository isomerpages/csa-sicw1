#### **GovWare Conference &amp; Exhibition 2024**

**17 October 2024 (Thursday)**  
*Time: 9.00am to 5.30pm (GMT +8)*

**GovWare Conference and Exhibition (GovWare 2024)** is the premier cybersecurity trade event held as part of Singapore International Cyber Week.&nbsp;

GovWare 2024 confronts the core issues of modern cybersecurity challenges head-on, under the theme of **"Securing Dynamic Digital Roadmaps: Relooking Signposts in Identity, Trust, and Resilience"**, uniting policymakers, tech innovators, and end-users across Asia and beyond, driving pertinent dialogues on the latest trends and critical information flow.&nbsp;

A key feature is the **GovWare Exhibition**, showcasing cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies from over 300 exhibitors serving across the NIST framework. Attendees get unparalleled opportunities to explore the latest advancements and solutions in the industry, from leading innovators to international pavilions, pioneering startups, and Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) innovation showcases from the Finance, Healthcare, and Transport sectors.&nbsp;

From the blurred lines between AI and cybersecurity to the proliferation of scams and deep fakes eroding public trust, the digital landscape is undergoing seismic shifts. It is imperative for stakeholders to come together to address modern security issues, rebuild trust, and chart a secure, inclusive digital future.&nbsp;

These issues and conversations are tackled in thought\-leading programmes, like the **CXO Plenary**, **GovWare Keynotes and Tracks**, CII focused sessions such as the **FSI**, **Healthcare**, and **Transport Forums**, **Startup Pitch Pit**, and **Tech Talk**. These programmes facilitate critical dialogues, foster collaborations, and provide a platform for attendees to connect with industry peers and learn from esteemed experts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

#### **High-Level Panel: Has the Era of Tech Broken Multilateralism?**

**17 October 2024 (Thursday)**  
*Time: 9.00am to 10.35am (GMT +8)*

**High-Level Panel: Has the Era of Tech Broken Multilateralism?**
Multilateralism has been the cornerstone of international cooperation. Historically, countries have come together to develop frameworks, convention and rules to address common issues facing the international community. Today, this same approach is taken to address challenges posed by new and rapidly evolving technologies, including developments in the digital and cyberspace. 

However, technologies have changed the way we interact and live. Is multilateralism still the appropriate and effective means to fostering global consensus on tackling digital and cyber issues? Given geopolitical tensions and rivalry, is multilateralism workable? In view of the complexity of issues facing us, do States and international organisations have the expertise and finesse to manage and respond to challenges to international security? What role can industry, academia and civil society play in helping to address these common security challenges? 

In this session, panellists will explore the impact of the technology era on multilateralism and the role of the UN in fostering global collaboration. They will discuss how nations can strengthen multilateralism to ensure that it is open and inclusive, where every country’s voice is heard and included.

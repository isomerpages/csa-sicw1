Cyber-attacks have developed in scale, sophistication and impact. In addition, recent geopolitical developments have increased tensions and risks of conflict arising from misunderstandings and misperception of cyber incidents. It is especially in such times that we should preserve avenues for dialogue, build up habits of cooperation and mutual trust, through an open and transparent exchange of views so that we reduce the risk of misunderstanding, escalation, and thus conflict in cyberspace. 
  
The session will underscore the importance of Confidence-Building Measures (CBMs) in preventing conflicts, avoiding misunderstandings and reducing tensions. The panelists will share about the efforts that various regional organisations have undertaken and how there can be better cross-regional and global exchanges on CBMs.

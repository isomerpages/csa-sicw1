#### ** SG Cyber Safe Partnership Appreciation**
 
**19 October 2022 (Wednesday)**  
*2.30pm – 3.00pm (GMT +8)*

*Format: Physical (by invitation only) + Livestreaming*

The SG Cyber Safe Partnership Programme galvanises and builds on the “multiplier effect” for the business community to support CSA in their cybersecurity awareness and adoption efforts. Since it was launched in October 2021, partnering organisations from the tech and adjacent sectors, as well as trade associations, chambers and societies, have collaborated with CSA to help raise the cybersecurity posture of Singapore enterprises.

The SG Cyber Safe Partnership Appreciation aims to recognise partnering organisations, CSA’s appointed Cyber Essentials and Cyber Trust certification bodies, and other third-party advocates that have made outstanding contributions to the programme. Join us in the appreciation ceremony and celebrate their achievements!

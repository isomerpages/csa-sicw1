#### **SICW Sessions: The Future of International Cyber Discussions**

As one of the six topics under the mandate of the current five-year UN Open-ended Working Group (2021 – 2025), the topic of regular institutional dialogue has seen vigorous debate, with differing visions of how international cyber discussions ought to proceed. Some States have called for international cyber discussions to focus on drafting and adopting a legally binding instrument to govern cyberspace, while others have advocated for these discussions to work towards deepening cross-regional understanding of the cyber normative framework and implementing the consensus decisions reached by previous UN Group of Governmental Experts and OEWG meetings.   
  
There has also been much discussion on how the views of multi-stakeholders including industry, academia and civil society groups can be heard and included in future UN cyber discussions. 
  
This session will explore the future direction and possible modalities of regular institutional dialogue, with a view to discuss how these mechanisms can facilitate progress on substantive topics discussed at international cyber discussions. The panelists will share their perspectives on the achievements and gaps of existing discussion platforms, discuss possible synergies and forms of cooperation for various stakeholders, as well as explore the role of regional organisations and multilateral platforms in developing and supporting international cyber discussions.

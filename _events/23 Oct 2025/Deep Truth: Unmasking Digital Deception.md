<h4><strong>Deep Truth: Unmasking Digital Deception</strong></h4>
<p><strong>23 October 2025 (Thursday)</strong>
<br><em>Time: 9.30am to 11.00am (GMT +8)</em>
</p>
<p>As AI-generated content becomes increasingly sophisticated, the risk is
that information threats will become all the more convincing, and pose
a greater threat to societal trust and national security.</p>
<p>Join us as CSA’s Distinguished Engineer &amp; Senior Director (Special
Projects) Stanley Tsang shares his insights on emerging AI-enabled threats,
followed by an exclusive demonstration of cutting-edge deepfake detection
technology by the Centre for Advanced Technologies in Online Safety (CATOS).
The session will highlight how policymakers can approach AI-enabled threats
and include a live demonstration of technologies from the first version
of CATOS’ Online Trust and Safety (OTS) Toolkit.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The demonstration will begin with Dr. Yang Yinping, Centre Director of
CATOS who will outline the centre’s focal areas in tackling harmful online
content and how deep tech and translational research are driving solutions
in collaboration with public agencies, universities, and industry partners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Afterwards, Dr. Wang Yunlong will showcase the increasing accessibility
of <strong>deepfake generation</strong> tools, underscoring the urgency of
addressing synthetic media threats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, Dr. Soumik Modal will present advanced capabilities in visual and
audio <strong>deepfake detection</strong>, along with an automatic fact-checking
solution to tackle deceptive synthetic media and non-factual claims.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, Ms. Therese Quieta will demonstrate the use of content authenticity
technologies, including the implementation of C2PA, to <strong>prevent misinformation</strong>,
and provide transparent provenance in digital media.</p>

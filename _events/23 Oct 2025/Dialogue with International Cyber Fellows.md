#### **Dialogue with International Cyber Fellows**

**23 October 2025 (Thursday)**  
*Time: 3.30pm to 5.00pm (GMT +8)*
<br>*Venue: SICW F, Level 3*

This alumnus gathering aims to bring together alumnus from the **Tallinn Cyber Diplomacy Summer School** and **United Nations-Singapore Cyber Fellowship** for a substantial and interactive exchange of ideas. Leveraging the diverse experiences of its members, the event will feature scenario-based discussions designed to foster dialogue on current challenges and strategies related to the implementation of international cyber stability frameworks. 

The scenario-based discussion centres around Navigating Critical Dependencies in the Digital age. In an era of increasing digital interconnectivity, organisations face heightened risk from critical dependencies, either related to supply chains, third-party vendors, critical infrastructure, and cross-border dependencies. A breach in any part of this web can have cascading effects. This alumnus event brings together cyber experts, diplomats and cybersecurity practitioners to explore a high-stakes, real-world inspired cyber incident through an interactive scenario.

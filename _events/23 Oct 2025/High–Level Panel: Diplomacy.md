#### **High-Level Panels: Diplomacy**

**23 October 2025 (Thursday)**  
*Time: 9.00am to 12.30pm (GMT +8)*

In an increasingly interconnected world, cybersecurity is no longer a technical issue — it is a matter of international diplomacy and strategic policy. The High-Level Panels on Diplomacy bring together senior government officials and cybersecurity experts to explore the evolving role of international cooperation in the face of pressing global cyber developments. Join us for an insightful morning of panels discussing how multi-stakeholders can navigate the complex intersection of diplomacy and cybersecurity. 

Further information on the High-Level Panels: Diplomacy will be updated shortly.

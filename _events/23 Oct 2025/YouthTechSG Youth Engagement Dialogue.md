#### **YouthTechSG Youth Engagement Dialogue**

**23 October 2025 (Thursday)**  
*Time: 9.00am to 11.30am (GMT +8)*

YouthTechSG is hosting a fireside chat featuring cybersecurity professionals who have taken diverse routes into the field. Through candid stories and lessons from their lived experiences, the session will spotlight multiple pathways into cyber and broaden exposure to the wider tech landscape. While open to all, the event is designed primarily for youth - pre-uni and university students who are curious about cybersecurity or exploring their next steps. Beyond the conversation, the engagement session aims to double as an informal networking space to connect like-minded peers, share takeaways, and bring insights back to their own communities - strengthening the youth-in-tech ecosystem.

#### **Deep Truth: Securing Against AI Deception**

**23 October 2025 (Thursday)**  
*Time: 1.00pm to 2.30pm (GMT +8)*

As AI-generated content becomes increasingly sophisticated, the ability to distinguish truth from digital deception is crucial for national security. Join us as CSA’s Distinguished Engineer &amp; Senior Director (Special Projects) Stanley Tsang shares his insights on emerging AI-enabled threats, followed by an exclusive demonstration of cutting-edge deepfake detection technology by the Centre for Advanced Technologies in Online Safety (CATOS). 
In the demonstration, Dr. Yang Yinping, Centre Director of CATOS, will outline the centre’s focal areas in tackling harmful online content and how deep tech and translational research are driving solutions in collaboration with public agencies, universities, and industry partners. The session will highlight Singapore’s strategic approach to digital resilience and include a live demonstration of technologies from the first version of CATOS’ Online Trust and Safety (OTS) Toolkit.

#### **High-Level Panels: Diplomacy**

**23 October 2025 (Thursday)**  
*Time: 9.00am to 12.30pm (GMT +8)*

In an increasingly interconnected world, cybersecurity is no longer a technical issue — it is a matter of international diplomacy and strategic policy. The High-Level Panels on Diplomacy bring together senior government officials and cybersecurity experts to explore the evolving role of international cooperation in the face of pressing global cyber developments. Join us for an insightful morning of panels discussing how multi-stakeholders can navigate the complex intersection of diplomacy and cybersecurity. 

**Segment I: Making Consensus Work: The UN and the Future of International Cyber Cooperation**
<br>*Time: 9.20am to 10.10am (GMT +8)*
<br>The recently concluded United Nations Open Ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies (2021 to 2025) has agreed to establish a permanent Global Mechanism on developments in the field of ICTs in the context of international security and advancing responsible State behaviour in the use of ICTs (“UN Global Mechanism on ICTs Security”) by consensus. It is expected that when it is established next year,  the UN Global Mechanism on ICTs Security will serve as a structured, permanent forum that will provide both continuity and progress to discussions on the rules, norms and principles of advancing responsible state behaviour as well as help foster international cooperation in cyberspace. However, there are also views that cyber discussions at the UN have not moved far enough to truly advance an effective rules-based multilateral order in cyberspace. Will the new permanent UN Global Mechanism on ICTs Security be effective in dealing with cyber issues of the day? How can the UN continue to move the needle on international cyber discussions?

**Segment II: Cyber Diplomacy: Who Else Should Sit at the Table?**
<br>*Time: 10.10am to 11.05am (GMT +8)*
<br>Cyber diplomacy has traditionally been viewed as the domain of States. Yet, as digital technologies continue to shape every aspect of society, industry players, civil society groups and other non-traditional stakeholders are increasingly seeking to exert influence over the shaping of global cyber outcomes. Some of these companies are so plugged into providing services considered essential to the digital economy that their resources and heft often make them difficult to ignore. The panel will explore the growing call to broaden participation to non-government stakeholders in cyber discussions so as to foster more inclusive, effective, and representative governance. It will consider whether governments remain best placed to lead decision-making on rules, norms, and standards, and if so, how industry, civil society, and other non-traditional stakeholders can contribute to these evolving and crucial discussions.

**Segment III: A World Apart: The Pursuit of Interoperability**
<br>*Time: 11.05am to 11.595am (GMT +8)*
<br>In a world increasingly shaped by fragmenting multilateralism, tech competition and diverging cyber standards, how can States ensure secure, cohesive, and resilient ecosystems? There is a growing concern that the international community is now standing at digital crossroads where our next steps could either strengthen our collective defense and the global digital economy through the establishment of interoperable standards, or potentially widen the digital divide amongst States, especially small and developing ones, by taking decisions that would encourage tech bifurcation. This panel will examine the roadblocks and opportunities in the pursuit of interoperable frameworks, rules, norms, and standards in cyberspace, and the role of international organisations such as the UN and ASEAN in promoting collaboration and cooperation.

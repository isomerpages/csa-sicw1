#### **High-Level Panels: Diplomacy**

**23 October 2025 (Thursday)**  

**Opening Address**
<br>*Time: 9.00am to 9.20am (GMT +8)*

**Panel I: Multilateral, Multipolar: Cyber Diplomacy in a Digital Age**
<br>*Time: 9.20am to 10.10am (GMT +8)*
<br>The rapid spread and adoption of transboundary digital technologies and the policy, legislative and diplomatic pressures on States to keep pace with them have strained the bases of State power, and at the same time, State-State relations that underpin the existing multilateral framework.

As technology continues to operate seamlessly across a borderless cyberspace, questions are increasingly being asked if the multilateral system built over the last eighty years will be able to preserve its relevance in the face of new and emerging technologies such as AI, which has the potential to erode the power and influence previously enjoyed by States alone, and distribute to it to other, non-State actors.

When technology threatens the very foundations of sovereignty, jurisdiction, and consensus-based cooperation, has multilateralism reached its limit? This panel aims to consider how cyber diplomacy should adapt in order to stay relevant and effectively govern a borderless global cyberspace, while ensuring that all voices, big and small, are heard.

**Panel II: A World Apart: The Pursuit of Interoperability**
<br>*Time: 10.10am to 11.00am (GMT +8)*
<br>In a world increasingly shaped by fragmenting multilateralism, tech competition and diverging cyber standards, how can States ensure secure, cohesive, and resilient ecosystems?

There is a growing concern that the international community is now standing at digital crossroads where our next steps could either strengthen our collective defence and the global digital economy through the establishment of interoperable standards, or potentially widen the digital divide amongst States, especially small and developing ones, by taking decisions that would encourage tech bifurcation.

This panel will examine the roadblocks and opportunities in the pursuit of interoperable frameworks, rules, norms, and standards in cyberspace, and the role of international organisations such as the UN and ASEAN in promoting collaboration and cooperation.

**Panel III: Making Consensus Work: The UN and the Future of International Cyber Cooperation**
<br>*Time: 11.00am to 11.40am (GMT +8)*
<br>The recently concluded United Nations Open Ended Working Group on security of and in the use of information and communications technologies (2021 to 2025) has agreed to establish a permanent Global Mechanism on developments in the field of ICTs in the context of international security and advancing responsible State behaviour in the use of ICTs (“UN Global Mechanism on ICTs Security”) by consensus.

It is expected that when it is established next year,  the UN Global Mechanism on ICTs Security will serve as a structured, permanent forum that will provide both continuity and progress to discussions on the rules, norms, and principles of advancing responsible state behaviour as well as help foster international cooperation in cyberspace.

However, there are also views that cyber discussions at the UN have not moved far enough to truly advance an effective rules-based multilateral order in cyberspace. Will the new permanent UN Global Mechanism on ICTs Security be effective in dealing with cyber issues of the day? How can the UN continue to move the needle on international cyber discussions?

#### **High-Level Panels: Diplomacy**

**23 October 2025 (Thursday)**  

**Opening Address**
<br>*Time: 9.00am to 9.20am (GMT +8)*

**Panel I: Multilateral, Multipolar: Cyber Diplomacy in a Digital Age**
<br>*Time: 9.20am to 10.10am (GMT +8)*
<br>The rapid spread and adoption of transboundary digital technologies and the policy, legislative and diplomatic pressures on States to keep pace with them have strained the bases of State power, and at the same time, State-State relations that underpin the existing multilateral framework.

As technology continues to operate seamlessly across a borderless cyberspace, questions are increasingly being asked if the multilateral system built over the last eighty years will be able to preserve its relevance in the face of new and emerging technologies such as AI, which has the potential to erode the power and influence previously enjoyed by States alone, and distribute to it to other, non-State actors.

When technology threatens the very foundations of sovereignty, jurisdiction, and consensus-based cooperation, has multilateralism reached its limit? This panel aims to consider how cyber diplomacy should adapt in order to stay relevant and effectively govern a borderless global cyberspace, while ensuring that all voices, big and small, are heard.

**Panel II: Cyber Diplomacy: Who Else Should Sit at the Table?**
<br>*Time: 10.10am to 11.05am (GMT +8)*
<br>Cyber diplomacy has traditionally been viewed as the domain of States. Yet, as digital technologies continue to shape every aspect of society, industry players, civil society groups and other non-traditional stakeholders are increasingly seeking to exert influence over the shaping of global cyber outcomes. Some of these companies are so plugged into providing services considered essential to the digital economy that their resources and heft often make them difficult to ignore. 

The panel will explore the growing call to broaden participation to non-government stakeholders in cyber discussions so as to foster more inclusive, effective, and representative governance. It will consider whether governments remain best placed to lead decision-making on rules, norms, and standards, and if so, how industry, civil society, and other non-traditional stakeholders can contribute to these evolving and crucial discussions.

**Panel III: A World Apart: The Pursuit of Interoperability**
<br>*Time: 11.05am to 11.55am (GMT +8)*
<br>In a world increasingly shaped by fragmenting multilateralism, tech competition and diverging cyber standards, how can States ensure secure, cohesive, and resilient ecosystems? 

There is a growing concern that the international community is now standing at digital crossroads where our next steps could either strengthen our collective defense and the global digital economy through the establishment of interoperable standards, or potentially widen the digital divide amongst States, especially small and developing ones, by taking decisions that would encourage tech bifurcation. 

This panel will examine the roadblocks and opportunities in the pursuit of interoperable frameworks, rules, norms, and standards in cyberspace, and the role of international organisations such as the UN and ASEAN in promoting collaboration and cooperation.

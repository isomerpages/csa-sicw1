#### **SPIRITCYBER Hackathon**

**23 October 2025 (Thursday)**  
*Time: 9.00am to 5.00pm (GMT +8)*

The interconnectedness of Singapore's Smart Nation ecosystem, from multi-sensory surveillance drones to smart automobiles, introduces new cyber-physical risks that traditional cybersecurity often misses. Digital breaches in these systems can lead to physical harm or service disruptions. Previous SPIRITCYBER hackathons have successfully exposed numerous zero-day vulnerabilities, highlighting a critical need for product security and greater manufacturer accountability. This yearâ€™s SPIRITCYBER hackathon combines an IoT bug bounty to uncover real-world critical vulnerabilities and an automotive CTF to tackle realistic and complex cybersecurity challenges.

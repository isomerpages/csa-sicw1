#### **Mobile Security Round Table**

**22 October 2025 (Wednesday)**  
*Time: 10.30am to 12.00pm (GMT +8)*

Mobile phones are no longer just tools of convenience, they are gateways to identify, financial assets, sensitive data and even national infrastructure. Yet, threats targeting mobile ecosystems have evolved faster than public understanding, policy frameworks, or platform protections. From sophisticated spyware to zero-day threats, scam/malicious apps disguised as 
shopping apps, mobile threats now span across technical, psychological and geopolitical dimensions. The world needs to rethink mobile security not as a technical afterthought, but as the foundation for digital trust in our connected future.

#### **Workforce Development Panel**

**22 October 2025 (Wednesday)**  
*Time: 3.00pm to 4.45pm (GMT +8)*

Talent attraction and development are a key success factor for a country’s cybersecurity strategy. Many countries share the desire to develop high-quality cybersecurity workforces which are capable to defend against global cyber threats that are growing in scale and sophistication. 

For the first time at SICW, we have gathered a panel that features government leaders from the International Coalition of Cyber Security Workforces (ICCSW) to share insights and strategies for developing world-class cybersecurity workforces.

The conversation will spotlight the vital roles of governments, industry, training and certification bodies, and professionals in uplifting skills, strengthening professional standards, and keeping pace with fast-evolving threats. The panel will also highlight the importance of international collaboration and explore opportunities for cross-border talent development and mutual recognition of competencies.

Additionally, presentations on ongoing international cross-recognition efforts such as the UK-SG Body of Knowledge Mapping project and harmonisation of cybersecurity roles across jurisdictions will be conducted by representatives from academia and industry.

Whether you are an employer, service provider, policymaker, or cybersecurity professional, this session offers fresh perspectives, practical approaches, and opportunities to connect with peers committed to raising the quality of the cybersecurity workforce.

Join us and be part of the dialogue shaping the future of the global cybersecurity workforce!

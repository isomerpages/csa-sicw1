#### **Cyber Accountability in Asia: Navigating Norms and Legal Frameworks**

**22 October 2025 (Wednesday)**  
*Time: 10.00am to 12.00pm (GMT +8)*

*Format: Closed Door Event*

Join Global Affairs Canada, the Stimson Center, the Centre for International Law (National University of Singapore), and the Centre of Excellence for National Security (CENS), S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies for a critical discussion on strengthening cyber accountability in Asia.
 
As cyber threats evolve and digital governance structures emerge, the need for robust accountability mechanisms becomes increasingly urgent. Building on the Stimson Center's Cyber Accountability Project and a recent regional workshop, this roundtable will explore regional approaches to cyber accountability within the framework of international law and norms.

Participants will examine both positive incentives and negative consequences that can deter malicious cyber activity. The discussion will address how Asian countries are implementing cyber accountability through national cybersecurity strategies, international law interpretations, norms implementation, among other actions; as well as discuss gaps and challenges.
 
This roundtable will share the findings and draft recommendations from a forthcoming Stimson Center report on regional cyber accountability. The report seeks to identify current practice, gaps and challenges, and to contribute to practical approaches that advance cyber accountability in practice.

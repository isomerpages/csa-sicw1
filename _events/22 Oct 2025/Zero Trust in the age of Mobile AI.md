#### **Zero Trust in the age of Mobile AI**

**22 October 2025 (Wednesday)**  
*Time: 10.00am to 11.30am (GMT +8)*
<br>*Venue: Angsana 3E, Level 3*

With rapid technological advancements and the growing adoption of AI and mobile devices in enterprise environments, it is essential for organisations and critical infrastructure operations to continuously reassess and strengthen their zero trust strategies. The dynamic nature of digital threats means that relying on outdated approaches can leave organisations vulnerable. Proactive zero trust measures must be embedded from the outset, ensuring that critical sectors remain resilient against evolving attacks.

CSA and Samsung Electronics jointly present—Zero Trust in the Age of Mobile AI—a symposium dedicated to exploring how critical infrastructure can adapt zero trust approaches to effectively address emerging risks posed by the integration of AI and mobile technologies within enterprise settings. Along with Cisco and Microsoft, the symposium will present participants with approaches to consider to better fortify their security postures in the age of mobile AI. 

The session will include presentations by each representing organisation, along with a panel discussion on the topic.

#### **Mobile Security Roundtable**

**22 October 2025 (Wednesday)**  
*Time: 10.30am to 12.00pm (GMT +8)*

Mobile phones are no longer just tools of convenience. They have become gateways to identity, financial services, sensitive data, and national infrastructure. As threats targeting mobile ecosystems grow in scale and sophistication, there is an urgent need to reexamine how security is integrated into mobile application development and how development and security teams can align more effectively.

The panel “**Can Cybersecurity and Development Teams Work Together to Achieve Secure Innovation?**” convenes leading developers, security strategists, and testing experts to examine the disconnect between cybersecurity and mobile application development. The discussion challenges entrenched assumptions and sheds light on how cross-disciplinary collaboration can drive secure innovation.

#### **A Coordinated Response: INTERPOL’s Efforts in Combatting Cybercrime Across Borders**

**22 October 2025 (Wednesday)**
<br>*Time: 1.30pm to 3.30pm (GMT+8)*
<br>*Venue: SICW B*

Join us to explore how INTERPOL builds trusted operational partnerships across governments, law enforcement, the private sector, and international organizations to combat cybercrime, in Singapore, Asia, and worldwide. Drawing on INTERPOL’s experience supporting Asian countries’ efforts to fight cybercrime, this interactive session will showcase how cross-sector cooperation has led to arrests, takedowns, and the long-term strengthening of national investigative capacity. 

Moderated by INTERPOL’s Cybercrime Director Neal Jetton, the session will feature experts from across the public and private sectors. Together, they will share lessons from past operations, the criticality of successful cooperation, and how collective action can meet the rising challenges of AI-driven and other emerging cyber threats. Participants will also have the opportunity to experience first-hand the challenges and decisions involved in coordinating a real cybercrime operation. 

Be part of the discussion and contribute to strengthening the future of combatting cybercrime around the globe.

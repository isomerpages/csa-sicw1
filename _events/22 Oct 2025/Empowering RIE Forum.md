#### **Empowering RIE Forum**

*Time: 2.00pm to 4.00pm (GMT +8)*

Cybersecurity is often described as a team sport requiring many parties to come together. The “Empowering RIE (Research, Innovation and Enterprise) Forum,” organised for the second time at the Singapore International Cyber Week, brings together cybersecurity practitioners from across government, industry and academia with the aim of fostering greater collaboration. This Forum provides a unique opportunity to gain insights from leading experts, as we build a more collaborative cybersecurity ecosystem to tackle present and future cybersecurity issues and challenges.

#### **High-Level Panel: The New UN Processes - Possibilities and Challenges**

**22 October 2025 (Wednesday)**  
*Time: 11.55am to 12.25pm (GMT +8)*
<br>*Venue: SICW A1, Level 3*

The successful conclusion of the 2nd UN Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on ICTs Security and the adoption of a consensus report proposing the setting up a UN Global Mechanism on ICTs security and the earlier successful conclusion of the work of the UN Ad Hoc Committee on Cybercrime with draft language for the UN Convention against Cybercrime are celebrated as milestone successes in international efforts against threats in cyberspace. However, there are questions if these mechanisms can indeed be effective and make a difference in meeting the challenges of newer and emerging threats such as AI, quantum and cyber enabled scams. This panel will discuss what needs to be done to ensure that these successes do not just remain diplomatic agreements on paper but make a difference on the ground.

#### **SICW Conversations (Operations)**

**6 October 2021 (Wednesday)**  
*7.00pm to 7.55pm (GMT +8)*

*Format: Virtual*

Supply chain attacks have been getting a lot more attention in recent years. From NotPetya to SolarWinds, each incident is affecting a massive amount of organisations and government agencies globally. Is the rise of supply chain attacks due to improved defences against more rudimentary attacks that resulted in a shift to look for less protected points of entry? Or is it the economies of scale offered by the network of  suppliers' customers? How can organisations adapt and protect themselves from such attacks, when you canâ€™t trust your vendors? 

We have assembled a host of security experts that had first hand experience on the most recent SolarWinds supply chain attack, to share their experience and help you understand how your organisation can navigate in this new zero trust environment.

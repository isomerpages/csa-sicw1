#### **International IoT Security Roundtable - Opening Segment and Leadership Dialogue**

**6 October 2021 (Wednesday)**  
*8.00pm – 11.00pm (GMT +8)*

*Format: Virtual*

The International IoT Security Roundtable serves as a platform to galvanise international efforts to address IoT security, a pressing issue given the rapid proliferation and pervasiveness of IoT devices which generally lack security provisioning. From the inaugural event in 2016, this platform has been instrumental in seeding international collaborations, leading to the launch of Singapore’s Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme (CLS) last year. Following on the strong interest, the event will bring together cyber leaders, standards leaders and industry perspective, for a Leadership Dialogue on “Internationalising IoT standards & certification towards building a trusted secure IoT ecosystem”. This year, the Technical Panel will focus on “Nexus of AI and IoT cyber analytics”.

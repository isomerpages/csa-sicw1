The Ministerial Roundtable Opening Session brings together Ministers, Cybersecurity Coordinators/Heads of Cybersecurity Agencies, and top industry players to discuss a multi-stakeholder approach to cybersecurity amidst the pandemic.

Against the backdrop of accelerated digitalisation and adoption of technologies to facilitate tele-working, this session will focus on the advantages and challenges of pursuing a multi-stakeholder approach in the evolving cyber threat landscape, as well as how all stakeholders (e.g. government, businesses, international organisations) should cooperate to maintain stability, security and resilience in cyberspace.

The Ministerial Roundtable Opening Session will be held as a hybrid session on 5 October 2021.

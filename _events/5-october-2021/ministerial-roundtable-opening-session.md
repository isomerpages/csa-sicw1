The Ministerial Roundtable Opening Session brings together Ministers, Cybersecurity Coordinators/Heads of Cybersecurity Agencies, and top industry players to discuss a multi-stakeholder approach to cybersecurity amidst the pandemic.

Against the backdrop of accelerated digitalisation and adoption of technologies to facilitate tele-working, this session will focus on the advantages and challenges of pursuing a multi-stakeholder approach in the evolving cyber threat landscape, as well as how all stakeholders (e.g. government, businesses, international organisations) should cooperate to maintain stability, security and resilience in cyberspace.

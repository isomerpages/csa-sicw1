**Global Digital Governance: Promise or Pipedream?**
<br>Digital technologies have become an integral part of our daily lives, bringing much benefit to people and economies across the globe. At the same time, some have raised concerns over the widespread disruption and impact that potential misuse and unregulated proliferation of digital technologies can bring.  

Given the unprecedented scale and reach of these technologies, there are now calls for a global digital governance to shape the rules of the road. However, in a world marked by geopolitical rivalry, military conflict and economic fragmentation, is it possible for countries to establish a common global digital governance framework? Are discussions on global digital governance able to keep up with evolving technologies and threats, or will governance always need to play catch up? 

This session explores the prospects and promise of global digital governance, and the challenges posed by the politics of divergence and polarisation.

**Regulating the Tech Industry: Too Little, Too Late?**
<br>As cyber threats evolve and grow more sophisticated, the challenge of regulating the technology industry becomes increasingly complex. The rapid pace of innovation and global reach of digital platforms have created a landscape where traditional regulatory approaches are often too little too late. 
These challenges are further compounded by the tension between innovation and security. 

This session will explore whether current regulatory measures are adequate and if they fall short in addressing emerging risks. Panellists will examine the effectiveness of existing frameworks, potential consequences of regulatory gaps and the delicate balance between security and innovation. Is our current approach to cybersecurity and technology regulation too much or too little? Is securing our digital future without compromising technological progress possible?

**A Vote of Confidence: Trust in the Digital Era**
<br>Digital technologies have revolutionised the way governments function, including elections, which are conducted by enhancing accessibility, efficiency, and engagement. As more countries turn to digital platforms for voting and political discourse, there growing concerns about the security and integrity of these systems. 

The unprecedented influence of digital technologies on democratic processes have sparked urgent debates over how to preserve the trust of voters in an era where misinformation, cyber threats, and data breaches are on the rise. 

This session will delve into the critical role of digital trust in upholding election integrity. As the geopolitical landscape becomes increasingly fragmented, how can we ensure that digital platforms used in elections are secure, transparent, and protected from influence? Can regulatory frameworks keep pace with evolving threats? This session will explore these pressing questions, focusing on the challenges and opportunities in maintaining voter confidence in the digital age.

**SICW HLP Opening Plenary – Panel 4**

**Tipping Point: Balancing Security &amp; Innovation in the Digital Era**
<br>Balancing security and innovation in the digital era presents a complex challenge for governments worldwide. The rapid advancement of technology fuels economic growth and supports increased connectivity to improve our digital way of life. However, this must be weighed against the fast-evolving threats posed by increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, further exacerbated by the misuse of emerging technologies. Nations must remain vigilant against emerging threats while fostering an environment conducive to creativity and growth. 

The panel will discuss the delicate balance between security and innovation in the digital era, emphasising national security implications. In an age where digital threats are increasingly sophisticated, what frameworks can governments adopt to protect national security without stifling growth? How can national security priorities coexist with the need for innovation?

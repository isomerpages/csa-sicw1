#### **SICW Women in Cyber**

**15 October 2024 (Tuesday)**  
*Time: 2.00pm to 3.30pm (GMT +8)*

Building and sustaining trust in our digital domain requires a whole-of-ecosystem effort. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and impact our communities, it's essential to tap into the unique perspectives and talents within our society to strengthen our collective defence. The SICW Women in Cyber event aims to promote cybersecurity as a career to female students, professionals, and non-professionals by featuring the achievements of trail blazing women who break barriers and bring inspiration to others in the cybersecurity field.

This year, participants can look forward to lighting talks, Q&amp;A segment, and networking opportunities with government agencies, industry partners, and professional associations.

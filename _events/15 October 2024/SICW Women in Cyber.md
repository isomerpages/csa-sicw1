#### **SICW Women in Cyber**

**15 October 2024 (Tuesday)**  
*Time: 2.00pm to 3.20pm (GMT +8)*

Creating and sustaining trust in our digital world calls for a comprehensive, ecosystem-wide collaboration. As cybersecurity threats become more sophisticated and impact our communities, tapping into the unique perspectives and talents across society is essential to strengthen our collective defenses. The SICW Women in Cyber event seeks to promote cybersecurity as a career for female students and working professionals, and inspire those new to the field by highlighting the remarkable achievements of trailblazing women who are breaking barriers and inspiring others in the cybersecurity field. These women will share their personal journeys of overcoming challenges in a traditionally male-dominated field, explore their pioneering contributions to the industry, present innovative solutions to cyber threats, and emphasize the importance of fostering diversity for a more secure future.

This year, participants can look forward to lightning talks, a Q&amp;A segment, and networking opportunities.

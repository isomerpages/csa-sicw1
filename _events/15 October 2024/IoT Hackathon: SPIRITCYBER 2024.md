#### **IoT Hackathon: SPIRITCYBER 2024**

**15 October 2024 (Tuesday)**  
*Time: 9.00am to 5.30pm (GMT +8)*

Project Omega is a national threat analytics initiative which collects and studies novel IoT exploitation attacks to generate awareness of IoT threats relevant to the government’s Smart Nation initiatives. The conduct of annual IoT Hackathon - “SPIRITCYBER” is part of the project deliverables to meet this objective. SPIRITCYBER is a 3-series hackathon which started from 2022 and aims to discover new IoT attack techniques through crowdsourced wisdom from the larger cybersecurity community. The hosting of the annual SPIRITCYBER hackathon event during SICW also serves to foster collaboration with industry and academia. The theme for this year SPIRITCYBER-24 is “Cybersecure Urban Living”.

**Programme**

| 9.00am to 9.30am     | **Opening Address by Dr Matthias Fischer, University Hamburg** |
| 9.30am to 5.00pm     | **Hackathon Conduct** |
| 10.00am to 10.30am     | **SOHO Demo**<br>This demo showcases how an enterprise firewall can be compromised and expose internal devices - such as printers, cameras, smart speakers, and network storage devices. Subsequently, an attacker may conduct lateral movement into the network to access confidential data and record conversations. |

#### **National Positions on International Law in Cyberspace: Challenges, Opportunities, and Best Practices**

**15 October 2024 (Tuesday)**  
*Time: 2.00pm to 4.00pm (GMT +8)*

States have agreed that international law is applicable and essential to maintaining peace, security and stability in the ICT environment. However, questions remain about how specific rules and principles of international law apply in cyberspace. The clarification and development of the law in this area occurs to a great extent through the publication of national positions on international law in cyberspace. Thus far, one regional organisation (the African Union) and over 30 States, predominantly from the Global North, have issued such positions. Other States are considering issuing their positions but many lack the capacity to do so.

This panel seeks to look into legal and policy questions for States when developing their national or common positions. In particular, it will discuss a) what is the legal and political importance of issuing national/common positions; b) what is their impact on the development of international law, c) what are the methodology and other procedural aspects involved in their preparation (including how to organize the relevant discussions at the national, regional and international level, who to consult, what kinds of information to collect), and d) what are the key legal and policy dilemmas facing States when developing such positions.

This panel is linked to the collaborative project [“The Handbook on Developing a National Position on International Law in Cyberspace: A Practical Guide for States”](https://ccdcoe.org/news/2024/ccdcoe-launches-new-international-cyber-law-project/), carried out by the University of Exeter, with the support of CCDCOE, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Estonia and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan.

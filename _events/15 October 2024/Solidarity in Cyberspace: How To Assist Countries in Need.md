#### **Solidarity in Cyberspace: How To Assist Countries in Need**

**15 October 2024 (Tuesday)**  
*Time: 4.00pm to 5.30pm (GMT +8)*

**Can international community help those in need? How coordinated efforts of states and private sector can help building up capacities, resilience and security of countries in need.**
<br>With growing intensity and complexity of threats, including those coming from aggressive actors in cyberspace, it is becoming doubtful whether individual states and societies can efficiently protect themselves without international cooperation. Coordinated assistance of partners can help to build capacities necessary to implement international law and voluntary norms in cyberspace by those willing, but lacking necessary instruments to so. However, it can also help to protect the vital needs of countries targeted by serious cyberattacks and malicious activates. This event will bring together experts to discuss collective efforts in enhancing cybersecurity, strengthening cyber resilience, offering capacity building and fostering public-private partnerships to assist those in need. The Tallinn Mechanism initiative will be discussed as a practical example providing a framework for international civilian cooperation across three lines of effort including assistance, resilience and recovery, and laying the groundwork for stronger partnerships in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.

#### **SICW Summit**

**20 October 2025 (Monday)**  
*Time: 6.00pm to 9.00pm (GMT +8)*

*Format: Closed Door Event*

As the digital domain becomes increasingly intertwined with global stability and economic growth, intensifying geopolitical competition, shifting dynamics in global governance, and the growing scale of cyber threats are collectively reshaping the digital and cyber landscape.

Beyond being a technical challenge, cybersecurity today is a strategic imperative that impacts international security, economic prosperity, and societal trust. The interconnected nature of cyberspace means that developments in one part of the world can have far-reaching consequences elsewhere, underscoring the urgency of building common ground and share responsibility in safeguarding the digital future.

Against the backdrop of uncertainty and rapid change, SICW will explore the impact of cyber developments on international security and the digital economy. It will focus on the shifting global environment and reaffirm the vital role of having an inclusive dialogue in shaping the next era of global cybersecurity.

The SICW Summit by-invitation only gala dinner will kick off the 10th Singapore International Cyber Week. It inaugurates discussions in the days to follow around this year’s SICW theme of “Shaping the Next Era of Global Cybersecurity”. International heads of country delegations, top senior officials, industry leaders and key cybersecurity personalities will attend the event.

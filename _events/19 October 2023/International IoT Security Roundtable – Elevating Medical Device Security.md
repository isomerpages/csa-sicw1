#### **International IoT Security Roundtable – Elevating Medical Device Security**

*Time: 9.00am - 12.00pm (GMT +8)*

In an era where technology intertwines with healthcare, ensuring the security of medical device has never been more crucial. The Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme for Medical Devices [CLS(MD)] is part of efforts from the Ministry of Health (MOH), Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), Health Sciences Authority (HSA), and Synapxe to raise cyber hygiene levels in medical devices. The Cybersecurity Label provides transparency on cybersecurity provisions and empowers healthcare users to make informed decisions when selecting medical devices. Join us to be a part of this transformative leap in healthcare security.

In an era where technology intertwines with healthcare, ensuring the security of medical device has never been more crucial. The Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme for Medical Devices [CLS(MD)] is part of efforts from the Ministry of Health (MOH), Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), Health Sciences Authority (HSA), and Synapxe to raise cyber hygiene levels in medical devices.

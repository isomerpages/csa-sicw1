*Time: 11.00am - 12.10pm (GMT +8)*

The United Nations provides a platform for all nations, big and small, to engage in open and inclusive dialogue and collective action. Given the fast-changing cyber landscape, how can we ensure stability, security, and inclusivity in this digital era? How can we foster global cooperation in pace with the developments in digital technology and cybersecurity?

The session will take a multifaceted outlook on international cyber discussions from the perspective of big and small players, and critically assess the UN’s effectiveness as the apex platform in facilitating international cyber discussions and fostering cyber cooperation.

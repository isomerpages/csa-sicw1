##### **About Singapore International Cyber Week**

The Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW) is Asia-Pacific’s most established cybersecurity event. Organised by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), SICW will bring together prominent global policy makers, thought leaders and industry experts to advance knowledge exchanges on key cybersecurity issues and solutions.

The theme for this year’s SICW is **“Living with COVID19 – Reimagining digital security risks and opportunities”**. The future of cybersecurity is tightly connected to the future of digital technology and the advancements of the cyberspace. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us how important digital capabilities are to all nations in ensuring that essential services, effective governance and communications can continue in a highly disrupted environment.

SICW 2021 will be held from 4 to 8 October 2021 through a combination of inter-linked physical and virtual meetings that will allow key leaders from governments, industry, academia and non-government organisations to explore the future of cyberspace cooperation from a broad range of perspectives.

The milestone 10th edition of the Singapore International Cyber Week comes at a critical global juncture. Intensifying geopolitical competition, shifting dynamics in global governance, and the growing scale of cyber threats are collectively reshaping the digital and cyber landscape.

Under the theme “**Shaping the Next Era of Global Cybersecurity**”, SICW 2025 will explore the impact of cyber developments on international security and the digital economy. It will focus on the shifting global environment and reaffirm the vital role of having an inclusive dialogue in shaping the next era of global cybersecurity.

SICW continues to serve as a premier global platform for policymakers, diplomats, technical experts, industry leaders, and academics to drive conversations on cyber and digital security. The 2025 edition will address a wide spectrum of issues—from cyber diplomacy and international cooperation, to emerging technologies such as AI and quantum, and the development of a trusted and secure digital ecosystem.

The Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW) is Asia-Pacific’s most established cybersecurity event since its inception in 2016. SICW brings together prominent global policy makers, thought leaders and industry experts to discuss, network, strategise and form partnerships in the cybersecurity space, as well as advance knowledge exchanges on key cybersecurity issues and solutions. It is a week where governments, industry, and academia converge, bringing together elements such as international law, cyber norms of behaviour and capacity building efforts that make up a secure, trusted and resilient cyberspace. 

The sixth edition of SICW will take place from 4 to 8 October 2021, under the theme of **“Living with COVID19 – Reimagining digital security risks and opportunities”**. COVID-19 has accelerated digitalisation and resulted in a growing dependence on technology, but this has also increased our exposure to cyber attacks. While a handful of countries have started on the bumpy road to recovery, most are  xperiencing a resurgence in infections. Living with COVID-19 will be a prolonged reality that the global community has to come to terms with. As private and public stakeholders reposition themselves or recalibrate policies to further promote digitalisation, what are the digital and cyber risks involved and how should we manage them? Amidst these risks, what are the new digital opportunities that did not exist pre-COVID-19? How can countries and organisations leverage these opportunities? These and many other questions will be tackled at SICW 2021.

Alongside the shift of business meetings towards a hybrid model, CSA will be organising SICW 2021 as a combination of inter-linked physical and virtual meetings that will allow key leaders from governments, industry, academia and non-government organisations to explore the future of cyberspace cooperation from a broader range of perspectives.

The Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW) is Asia-Pacific’s most established cybersecurity event since its inception in 2016. As countries continue to adapt and manage the pandemic,SICW 2021 will focus on how countries can work together to leverage the new opportunities that did not exist prior to the pandemic, and to deal with the growing cyber threats by building a secure and resilient cyberspace that serves as an enabler of economic progress in the digital future. SICW 2021 continues the momentum of conversations among top policy makers, industry leaders and domain experts from ASEAN and across the world on key areas of cybersecurity, including emerging digital opportunities and threats, evolution of cyberspace and cybersecurity policies, implementation of cyber norms, Internet of Things (IoT) and Operational Technology (OT) security, and coordinated cyber capacity-building.

The sixth edition of SICW will take place from 4 to 8 October 2021, under the theme of “Living with COVID19 – Reimagining digital security risks and opportunities”. COVID-19 has accelerated digitalisation and resulted in a growing dependence on technology, but this has also increased our exposure to cyber attacks. While a handful of countries have started on the bumpy road to recovery, most are experiencing a resurgence in infections. Living with COVID-19 will be a prolonged reality that the global community has to come to terms with. As private and public stakeholders reposition themselves or recalibrate policies to promote digitalisation, what are the digital and cyber risks involved and how should we manage them? Amidst these risks, what are the new digital opportunities that did not exist pre-COVID-19? How can countries and organisations leverage these opportunities? These and many other questions will be tackled at SICW 2021.

Alongside the shift of business meetings towards a hybrid model, CSA will be organising SICW 2021 as a combination of inter-linked physical and virtual meetings that will allow key leaders from governments, industry, academia and non-government organisations to explore the future of digital and cyber security cooperation from a broader range of perspectives.

All SICW in-person events will take place at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore.

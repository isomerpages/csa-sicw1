#### **Mr Lee Kian Chong**

*CEO & Co-Founder*  
CyberLitmus Pte Ltd

##### **Biography**
Lee Kian Chong is the Co-Founder and CEO of CyberLitmus, a cybersecurity SaaS company. He drives both business development, and the companyâ€™s cybersecurity awareness offering. His passion for the field and education methodologies led him to develop a holistic, fully managed programme with hyper-realistic & localised phishing simulations, bite-sized microlearning, and 24/7 leak monitoring.

As cyber attacks become more sophisticated, organisations remain susceptible with the human factor remaining a key vulnerability. Thus, he strives to work together with the community to improve accessibility to security awareness programmes, and support the development of strong security cultures.  

He has completed the Advanced Certificate in Learning and Performance (ACLP) as well as the SANS Security Awareness Professional (SSAP) programme. He graduated with a MPhil in Management (Commendation) from the University of Cambridge and a BSc in Chemistry (First Class Honours) from Imperial College London.

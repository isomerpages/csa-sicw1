Henry began his career 2005 with T-Systems International as a security evaluator specialising in ISO/IEC15408, also known as Common Criteria.

He joined the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) in 2014, where he is responsible for several key initiatives such as the Singapore Common Criteria Scheme and the Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme (CLS) for consumer connected device. He is currently working on several initiatives, such as:
1.	the joint partnership with HSA, MOH, IHIS and industry in developing a labelling scheme for connected medical device (i.e. to be announced during SICW 2022) and;
2.	developing the Testing, Inspection and Certification (TIC) ecosystem in Singapore, which include the opening of the National Integrated Centre for Evaluation (NiCE) in May 2022. 
 
Henry also represents Singapore in ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27/WG 3 and WG4, in contributing towards the development of standards relating to security evaluation and IoT, with the aim to reduce fragmentation and avoid duplicative testing across borders.

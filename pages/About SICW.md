Organised by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), the Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW) is the Asia-Pacific’s most established cybersecurity event. CSA is Singapore’s national authority for cybersecurity and plays a pivotal role in Singapore’s Smart Nation and digital economy ambitions.  

The ninth edition of the SICW will take place from 14 to 17 October 2024, at Sands Expo and Convention Centre, Singapore. Geopolitical and economic contestations, supply chain vulnerabilities and increasing pressures on the democratic process have impacted international security and stability. Under the theme of “**Trust and Security in the Digital Era**”, SICW 2024 will drive critical conversations and partnerships to foster trust and enhance security in the digital and cyber domain, amid an increasingly fragmented global landscape.  

The event will bring together global policy makers, industry leaders and top academics from across the world to exchange best practices and strengthen international cooperation on topics ranging from harnessing digital opportunities and tackling cyber challenges, the evolution of cyberspace and cybersecurity policy, the implementation of cyber norms, as well as security in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Operational Technology (OT) space.  

Key SICW 2024 events include the **SICW Summit**, the **SICW High-Level Opening Plenary**, a series of **SICW High-Level Panel Sessions** focusing on diverse cybersecurity policy, operational, technical and diplomacy topics, as well as the SICW Women in Cyber plenary and International IoT Security Roundtable. Other various high-level events held on the sidelines include the ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity (AMCC) and Special Session. 

The [GovWare Conference and Exhibition 2024](https://www.govware.sg/govware/2024/event-info), the region’s premier trade show for cybersecurity, will also be held in conjunction with SICW. GovWare programmes include expert-led keynotes, cutting-edge tech showcase by leading global and local innovators, and capacity-development initiatives such as Singapore Cyber Conquest and Pitch Pit for startups.

Organised by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), the **Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW)** is the Asia-Pacific’s most established cybersecurity event. CSA is Singapore’s national authority for cybersecurity and plays a pivotal role in Singapore’s Smart Nation and digital economy ambitions.

The tenth edition of the SICW takes place from 20 to 23 October 2025, at Sands Expo and Convention Centre, Singapore. 

This milestone edition comes at a critical global juncture. Intensifying geopolitical competition, shifting dynamics in global governance, and the growing scale of cyber threats are collectively reshaping the digital and cyber landscape.

Under the theme “**Shaping the Next Era of Global Cybersecurity**”, SICW 2025 will explore the impact of cyber developments on international security and the digital economy. It will focus on the shifting global environment and reaffirm the vital role of having an inclusive dialogue in shaping the next era of global cybersecurity. 

SICW continues to serve as a premier global platform for policymakers, diplomats, technical experts, industry leaders, and academics to drive conversations on cyber and digital security. The 2025 edition will address a wide spectrum of issues—from cyber diplomacy and international cooperation, to emerging technologies such as AI and quantum, and the development of a trusted and secure digital ecosystem.

Key SICW 2025 events include the **SICW Summit**, the **SICW High-Level Panels: Opening Plenary**, a series of **SICW High-Level Panel Sessions** focusing on diverse cybersecurity policy, operational, technical and diplomacy topics, as well as the **SICW Women in Cyber** plenary and **AI security**.

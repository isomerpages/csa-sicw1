Organised by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), the Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW) is the Asia-Pacific’s most established cybersecurity event. CSA is Singapore’s national authority for cybersecurity and plays a pivotal role in Singapore’s Smart Nation and digital economy ambitions. 
 
The eighth edition of the SICW will take place from 16 to 19 October 2023, at Sands Expo and Convention Centre, Singapore. Under the theme of “Building Trust and Security in the Emerging Digital Order”, SICW 2023 will explore the impact of digital developments on the global multilateral order, and how security can be developed to enable trust in the digital and cyber space.
 
The event will bring together global policy makers, industry leaders and top academics from across the world to exchange best practices and strengthen international cooperation on topics ranging from harnessing digital opportunities and tackling cyber challenges, the evolution of cyberspace and cybersecurity policy, the implementation of cyber norms, as well as security in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Operational Technology (OT) space. 
 
Key SICW 2023 events include the **SICW Summit**, the **SICW Ministerial Roundtables**, a series of **SICW Sessions** focusing on diverse cybersecurity policy, operational, technical and diplomacy topics, as well as the SICW Women in Cyber plenary and International IoT Security Roundtable. There will also be various high-level events held on the sidelines including the ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity (AMCC) and Special Session, the ASEAN Cybercrime Prosecutors’ Roundtable Meeting (ACPRM), the ASEAN Senior Officials Roundtable on Cybercrime (SORC), and the 5G Symposium.

The GovWare Conference and Exhibition 2023, the region’s premier trade show for cybersecurity, will also be held in conjunction with SICW. GovWare programmes include expert-led keynotes, cutting-edge tech showcase by leading global and local innovators, and capacity-development initiatives such as Singapore Cyber Conquest and Pitch Pit for startups.

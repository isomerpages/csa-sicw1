Organised by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), the Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW) is the Asia-Pacific’s most established cybersecurity event.  

The event brings together global policy makers, industry leaders, cybersecurity professionals and academics from across the world to exchange best practices and foster international cooperation. Participants explore themes from harnessing digital opportunities and tackling cyber challenges to the evolution of cyberspace and cybersecurity policy, the implementation of cyber norms, as well as security in the Internet of Things (IoT) and Operational Technology spaces.

The SICW programme features the **SICW Summit**, the **SICW High-Level Panels: Opening Plenary**, a series of **SICW High-Level Panel Sessions** focusing on diverse cybersecurity policy, operational, technical and diplomacy topics, as well as the **SICW Women in Cyber** plenary and **International IoT Security Roundtable**. The event also convenes important regional dialogues, bringing together ASEAN leaders for the ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity and ASEAN Senior Officials Roundtable on Cybercrime.

The [GovWare Conference and Exhibition](https://www.govware.sg/govware), the region’s premier cybersecurity trade show, is held alongside SICW, featuring expert-led keynotes and cutting-edge tech showcases by global and local innovators.

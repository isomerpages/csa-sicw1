#### **International IoT Security Roundtable – Mobile Ecosystem Security Seminar**

**18 October 2023 (Wednesday)**  
*Time: 2.00pm to 4.30pm (GMT +8)*

With mobile applications becoming the most popular way users conduct online banking, communicate with friends and family, and even perform their work activities, it’s imperative that users stay safe while doing all of these sensitive tasks on their mobile devices. This requires strong collaboration between mobile app developers, the operating system and device manufacturers as well as policymakers to ensure that the proper policies, education, and tools exist to ensure mobile apps keep user data safe and are resilient to potential cyber attacks. This event will invite Google, app developers, associations and ecosystem partners to share their perspectives on ways to better keep users and their data safe within their apps across mobile devices and share existing challenges.

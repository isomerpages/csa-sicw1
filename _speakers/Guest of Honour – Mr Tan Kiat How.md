Mr Tan Kiat How is the Senior Minister of State at the Ministry of Digital Development and Information, where he focuses on the Ministry’s efforts in supporting digital transformation of businesses and helping the Small-Medium Enterprises improve their productivity and access new markets. Mr Tan is concurrently the Senior Minister of State for National Development.

Mr Tan also chairs REACH, the lead agency in facilitating whole-of-government efforts in engaging and connecting with Singaporeans on national and social issues close to their hearts, as well as the National Translation Committee. Mr Tan had also previously served in the Prime Minister’s Office as Minister of State. 

Prior to entering politics, Mr Tan spent close to 20 years in the public service. He began his career as an IT consultant in the Ministry of Education, under a National Computer Board scholarship.

As a computer engineer by training, Mr Tan has a passion for using technology to enhance the lives of Singaporeans. He led the shaping of the national cybersecurity masterplan and championed a more digital economy and society, including the ethical use of Artificial Intelligence, roll-out of 5G mobile networks, and launch of the SG Digital Ambassadors Programme. He helped to develop the Intelligent Nation 2015 blueprint and drove the implementation of the nationwide fibre-to-the-home infrastructure.

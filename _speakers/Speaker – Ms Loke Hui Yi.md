#### **Ms Loke Hui Yi**

*Vulnerability Management Head,<br>TikTok<br>Singapore*

##### **Biography**
Hui Yi is a seasoned cybersecurity professional with a unique career trajectory that spans both offensive and defensive security. She began her career as a developer before transitioning into product security, where she tested applications for government systems prior to their deployment, ensuring their introduction would not increase system risk. Her experience then moved to the front lines of attack on the red team, where she built malware and C2 systems and planned and staged full-scale operations. Her experience then shifted to the defensive side, where she handled incident response for product-related incidents on the blue team.

Now, as the Vulnerability Management Head at TikTok, Hui Yi brings this well-rounded perspective to her work. She leverages her comprehensive understanding of the entire attack lifecycle, from initial exploitation to incident response, to build and lead a high-performing technical team. Her focus is on proactively managing vulnerabilities and addressing threats, strategically positioning TikTok to be better prepared for future risks. Hui Yi is a strong advocate for empowering women in the technical fields and looks forward to sharing her insights on building a resilient security posture.

Director Coker is a retired Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) senior executive, former National Security Agency (NSA) senior executive and career Naval Officer. 

As National Cyber Director, Coker’s priorities include strengthening federal coherence and collaboration in cyberspace; implementing America’s National Cybersecurity Strategy; developing a robust cyber workforce; advancing cyber regulatory harmonization; and building Sector Risk Management Agency (SRMA) and State, Local, Tribal and Territorial (SLTT) cybersecurity capability and capacity.

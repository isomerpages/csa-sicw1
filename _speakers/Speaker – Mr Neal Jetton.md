##### **Biography**
Neal Jetton leads the INTERPOL Global Cybercrime Programme which aims to reduce the global impact of cybercrime through the enhancement of cyber threat response, the coordination of cybercrime operations, and the development of cyber strategies and capabilities.

Prior to joining INTERPOL, he served in leadership positions prioritizing the coordination of cybercrime investigations with a global network of law enforcement partners, as well as the advancing of cyber policies and strategies. These efforts have allowed for more robust capabilities to impose costs to cyber criminals and bring justice to their victims.

Most recently, he led the Criminal Mission Center at the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force in Washington, D.C. driving effective whole-of-government efforts for transnational cybercrime investigations. He served as the law enforcement expert to the Department of Homeland Security’s Cyber Policy division where he provided executive leadership, advice and guidance on the development and implementation of priorities in the areas of cybercrime investigations, cybersecurity, and emerging technology.

During his career with the U.S. Secret Service, he led teams of agents across the globe in successfully developing and implementing operational and tactical plans pursuant to protective operations logistics with the assistance of international law enforcement partners.

He holds Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in biology and a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology.

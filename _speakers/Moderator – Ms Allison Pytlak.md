##### **Biography**
Allison Pytlak is the Senior Fellow and Director of the Cyber Program at the Stimson Center, a research institute based in Washington, D.C. 

Her research on cybersecurity topics largely examines the interplay between cyber operations and international relations including multilateral governance structures such as United Nations (UN) processes and frameworks. Current projects focus on accountability and deterrence in cyberspace, including in the Indo-Pacific; multilateral cyber policy-making; and cybercrime scam operations. Prior to joining the Stimson Center, Pytlak managed the Disarmament Program of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom and served in the Secretariat of the Control Arms Coalition. She has leveraged her significant experience in multilateral arms control and disarmament policy to identify opportunities for effectively advancing international law, norms and governance frameworks towards reducing cyber harm. Pytlak has also researched and published extensively about the gendered and human rights-based dimensions of digital security. She holds an Honours B.A. from the University of Toronto and an M.A. from the City University of New York.

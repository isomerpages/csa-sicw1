#### **Prof Ding Jintai**

*Professor, <br>Tsinghua University*


##### **Biography**
Jintai Ding is one of the designers of the only quantum resistant key establishment standard by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), ML-KEM (FIPS 203), which was formerly called Kyber. He is the inventor and patent owner of the first quantum key exchange which was one of the two patents licensed to NIST for ML-KEM. He is the incoming Dean of the School of Mathematics and Physics at Xi’an Jiaotong Liverpool University and a Charles Phelps Taft Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Cincinnati. Prior to joining XJTLU, he was a full professor at Tsinghua University. He received his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1995. His research was in quantum affine algebras, where he was credited for the invention of the Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra. His current interest is in post-quantum cryptography. He and his colleagues developed Rainbow signature, a third round candidate and finalist in the NIST post-quantum standardization process. He and his colleagues completely broke a NIST second round post-quantum signature candidate LUOV and a third round candidate GeMSS (HFEv-), for which they won the best paper honorable mention award for Crypto 2021. He also served as co-chair for the 2nd, 10th and 11th International Conference on Post-Quantum Cryptography.

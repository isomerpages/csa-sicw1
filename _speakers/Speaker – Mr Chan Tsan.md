##### **Biography**
Mr Chan Tsan is the Chief Executive of HTX (Home Team Science and Technology Agency) and concurrently the Deputy Secretary (Development) in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).&nbsp;&nbsp;

In a career spanning more than 20 years in MHA, Chan Tsan has held key appointments in engineering, operational and leadership positions. He has led strategic planning and long-term development efforts as well as delivered mission-critical capabilities for the Home Team. He has also worked closely with all Home Team Departments in both capability development and operational domains.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Since its formation on 1 Dec 2019, HTX has grown into a leading Science and Technology agency dedicated to Public Safety and Security. HTX has integrated diverse scientific and engineering talent, facilities and platforms to innovate and deliver transformative and operationally-ready solutions that have deepened and extended the Home Team’s capabilities. One such solution is ICA’s New Clearance Concept, a first-of-its-kind passport-less immigration system.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Recognising the immense potential of tapping the innovative startup ecosystem, Chan Tsan led the establishment of HTX’s innovation centre, Hatch, in May 2023 to work with startups from all across the globe to develop dual-use technologies and solutions to meet the Home Team’s operational challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The successful partnerships HTX has forged since its inception inspired Chan Tsan to further boost HTX’s international collaborations in April 2024 by creating a conference and exhibition platform with Milipol Asia-Pacific called Milipol Asia-Pacific &amp; TechX Summit (MAP-TXS). MAP-TXS 2024 brought 2,400 delegates and almost 12,000 visitors from around the world together to explore and showcase the latest in public safety tech and thought leadership. The event returns in April 2026, rebranded as Milipol TechX.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Under Chan Tsan’s leadership, HTX launched its AI Movement in June 2024 with the aim to transform HTX into an AI-first agency and to exploit the power of AI to force multiply the Home Team.&nbsp;&nbsp;

With the public safety landscape constantly evolving, Chan Tsan’s strategic foresight and visionary leadership continue to dynamically position HTX to advance science and technology, and secure Singapore’s future.&nbsp;

Chan Tsan was awarded the Public Service Commission Singapore Government Scholarship in 1992. He has a Diplome D’ingenieur (post-graduate degree in engineering) in Telecommunications from Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications (ENST) in Paris, France (1998). He received the Public Administration Medal (Silver) in 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp;

More recently, he was the recipient of the Most People-Focused CEO Award at the HR Excellence Awards 2024 and the Digital CEO of the Year Award at the Spark Asia Digital Leader Awards 2025.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Chan Tsan is fluent in English and Mandarin and conversant in French. He is married with four children.

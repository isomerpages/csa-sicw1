##### **Biography**
Derek Manky brings more than twenty years of experience to a strategic and visionary cyber security role, working with FortiGuard Labs at Fortinet. Manky leads FortiGuard Labs’ global threat intelligence team which consults with leading CSOs/CISOs of Fortune 500 companies worldwide across multiple industries. Manky provides thought leadership to industry and has presented research and strategy worldwide at many premier security conferences. As a cyber security expert, his work has included meetings with leading political figures and key policy stakeholders globally, including law enforcement, which helps define the future of cyber security. In 2019, he was selected as one of six nationwide delegates to represent Canada as a Canadian leader from the field of cyber, through his leadership and expertise in Cyber Security. He is a contributing author to the World Economic Forum Partnership against Cybercrime Report. Manky has been recipient of his technical University’s honorable 2019 BCIT Distinguished Alumni Award.

Manky orchestrates global threat intelligence initiatives with Fortinet, including the World Economic Forum Partnership against Cybercrime, Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA), NATO NICP, INTERPOL Project Gateway, and the Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST). Manky has been with the Cyber Threat Alliance since it was founded in May 2014 and sits on the board. In addition to the Cyber Threat Alliance board, Derek sits on the MITRE Engenuity Center for Threat Informed Defense Advisory Council, and the World Economic Forum’s Cybercrime Atlas Executive Committe. His vision is applied to help shape the future of proactive cyber security, with the ultimate goal to make a positive impact towards the global war on cybercrime.

He works globally with the security industry and Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) to connect the dots, streamlining mitigation advice and threat forecasts based on personal knowledge and a team of world class experts at Fortinet and FortiGuard Labs. This strategy is integrated into advanced technology frameworks to fight cyber-attacks, while keeping clients secure. Manky designed a zero-day vulnerability disclosure framework, which has been reliably used for years to responsibly fix security issues before black hat attackers get a chance to exploit victims.

Manky sits on a computing science advisory committee and meets with universities to provide security industry input that he hopes will help shape the bright young minds of tomorrow. In an effort to educate, he is regularly featured in top tier media and guest articles including, but not limited to, CNN, Bloomberg, NBC, MSNBC, Wired, CSO, Forbes, Wall Street Journal, Dark Reading, and the Financial Times. Manky has also been the recipient of CRN’s ‘Security Superstar’ award. He continues to dedicate his career to security, research and education.

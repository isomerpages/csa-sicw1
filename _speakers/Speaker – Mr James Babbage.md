#### **Mr James Babbage**

*Director General Threats, <br>National Crime Agency<br>United Kingdom*

##### **Biography**
James joined the NCA as Director General Threats in June 2023.   

In this role he is responsible for leading the whole-of-system operational response to serious and organised crime (SOC), with NCA coordinating contributions from policing and other national agencies. The focus is on reducing crime and harms, through investigative disruption and also collaboration with the finance and tech industry to design out crime.  
 
Immediately before joining NCA James established and led the UK National Cyber Force, a partnership between Defence and the intelligence agencies.  He is committed to strengthening public discourse on intelligence and cyber matters; National Cyber Force: Responsible Cyber Power in Practice, published in April 2023, sets out how principles of responsible state behaviour apply to offensive cyber operations. 

NCA’s action against the Lockbit ransomware group early in 2024 shows how public cyber disruptions and industry partnerships are a critical part of a broader strategy to counter the fast growing online SOC threat. A major focus for James in his current role is around how we can collectively improve our strategic and systemic response to fraud.

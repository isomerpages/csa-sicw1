![](/images/Media_Accreditation_Key_Dates_2.png)

**1. Media Accreditation Guidelines**

Media personnel interested in covering the **Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW) 2025** must register as media, NOT as visitors. The media accreditation guidelines aim to facilitate maximum media access while ensuring safety and security for all SICW 2025 participants.

Successful applicants will have access to **all open sessions** at SICW and GovWare 2025, as well as the exhibition show floor at Level 1 of the Sands Expo and Convention Centre. 

Registration opens on **18 August 2025 and closes at 1200hrs (GMT +8) on 15 October 2025**. Applicants will need to complete an online form and submit all required documents for review. All applications are subject to organiser’s approval.

**2. Accreditation Principles**

Editors of publications and media agencies are requested to take note of the following principles to ensure that media accreditation is restricted to professional journalists, photographers, camera crew and bloggers:
<br><br>i. The organiser considers the Media Pass to be a working tool to be used only by bona fide members of the press. Marketing personnel, sub-editors, staff of the publication’s secretariat, etc. <u>cannot</u> be accredited as media. 
<br><br>ii. The organiser will only accredit media personnel from publications and agencies, and professional bloggers:
* With a circulation size and quality that fulfil the criteria of the organiser.
* With a format and quality that fulfil the criteria of the organiser.
* With published content and expertise on cybersecurity, technology and other relevant topics that appeal to the intended audiences for the event.
* With a sizeable following and sphere of influence, areas of interest and quality that fulfil the criteria of the organiser.

iii.	Internal company publications cannot be accredited as media. However, at the sole discretion of the organiser, and where the quality and circulation criteria justify the organiser’s consideration, such publications may be eligible for accreditation on a case-by-case basis.
<br><br>iv.	Under no circumstance will advertising and public relations agencies (or similar companies and organisations) be accredited as media, nor will the organiser issue any media passes to representatives (press officers or otherwise) of sponsors, suppliers, and exhibitors.
<br><br>v.	Double accreditation (registering as both media and visitor) is not permitted.

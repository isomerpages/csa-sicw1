### **Media Accreditation**

**1.1 Media Accreditation Guidelines**

The media accreditation principles below are intended to give the media as much access as
possible while ensuring the safety, security and comfort of all participants of the **Singapore
International Cyber Week 2022 (SICW 2022)**.

Media accreditation will commence on **22 August 2022 and close at 1200hrs (GMT +8), 11
October 2022**. Applicants will need to fill in an online form and submit all required
documents to be accredited. All media accreditation applications will be subject to the
approval of the organisers.

Please contact [**Maxine.Tan@hkstrategies.com**](mailto:Maxine.Tan@hkstrategies.com) for online application access.

**1.2 Accreditation Principles**

Editors of publications and media agencies are requested to take note of the following
principles to ensure that media accreditation is restricted to professional journalists,
photographers and bloggers:
<br><br>i. The organiser considers the Media Pass to be a working tool to be used only by bona
fide members of the press. Marketing personnel, sub-editors, staff of the publication’s
secretariat, etc. cannot be accredited as media.
<br><br>ii. The organiser will only accredit publications, agencies, and professional bloggers:
* With a circulation size and quality that fulfil the criteria of the organiser
* With a format and quality that fulfil the criteria of the organiser
* With a sizeable following and sphere of influence, areas of interest and quality
that fulfil the criteria of the organiser

<br>iii. Internal company publications cannot be accredited as media. However, at the sole
discretion of the organiser, and where the quality and circulation criteria justify the
organiser’s consideration, such publications may be eligible for accreditation on a
case-by-case basis.
<br><br>iv. Under no circumstance will advertising and public relations agencies (or similar
companies and organisations) be accredited as media, nor will the organiser issue
any media accreditation to representatives (press officers or otherwise) of sponsors,
suppliers and exhibitors.
<br><br>v. It should be noted that no double accreditation is allowed (e.g. as media and as
delegate).

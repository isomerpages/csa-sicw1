### **Media Accreditation**

#### 1.1 Media Accreditation Guidelines

The media accreditation principles below are intended to give the media as much access as possible while ensuring the safety, security and comfort of all participants of the Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW) 2021.

Media accreditation will commence on **8 September 2021 and close on noon of 22 September 2021**. All media accreditation applications will be subject to the approval of Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) and Hill+Knowlton Strategies (H+K Strategies).

To access the online accreditation form, please email [sicw2020media@hkstrategies.com](mailto:sicw2020media@hkstrategies.com). 

#### 1.2 Accreditation Principles

Editors of publications and media agencies are requested to take note of the following principles to ensure that media accreditation is restricted to professional journalists, photographers, television crew and bloggers:

i. The organiser considers the Media Pass to be a working tool to be used only by bona fide members of the press. Marketing personnel, sub-editors, staff of the publication’s secretariat, etc. cannot be accredited as media.

ii. The organiser will only accredit publications, agencies, and professional bloggers:

+ With a circulation size and quality that fulfil the criteria of the organiser
+ With a format and quality that fulfil the criteria of the organiser
+ With a sizeable following and sphere of influence, areas of interest and quality that fulfil the criteria of the organiser

iii. Internal company publications cannot be accredited as media. However, at the sole discretion of the organiser, and where the quality and circulation criteria justify the organiser’s consideration, such publications may be eligible for accreditation on a case by case basis. 

iv. Under no circumstance will advertising and public relations agencies (or similar companies and organisations) be accredited as media, nor will the organiser issue any media accreditation to representatives (press officers or otherwise) of sponsors, suppliers and exhibitors.

v. It should be noted that no double accreditation is allowed (e.g. as media and as delegate).

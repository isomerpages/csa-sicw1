##### **Biography**
With 29 years of law enforcement experience, Craig Jones leads INTERPOL’s Cybercrime Directorate and the Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) for its Global Cybercrime Programme. Aimed at reducing the global impact of cybercrime and protecting communities for a safer world, the Programme focuses on three core pillars of cybercrime threat response, cybercrime operations, and cyber capabilities development for law enforcement worldwide.

Mr Jones oversees the Programme and its activities to deliver outcomes that are in line with the Programme’s objectives at the tactical, operational and strategic levels. He puts great emphasis on Public-Private Partnership to augment cybercrime datasets to deliver the most accurate and effective cybercrime intelligence and operational support for member countries. He coordinates regional and global working groups with Heads of Cybercrime Units in member countries to provide tailored support pertaining to the regional needs and challenges.

Prior to joining INTERPOL, Mr Jones held several senior operational and coordination management positions in the UK law enforcement, most recently at the National Crime Agency in the UK. In this capacity, he coordinated UK’s law enforcement response to the National Cyber Security Programme, which underpinned the UK’s National Cyber Security Strategy.

Mr Jones is recognized as a strategic thinker, shaping policies that deliver outcomes and results against national, regional and global cyber strategies. He also anticipates and forecasts the long-term impact of national and international developments in the economic, political, environmental, social and technological domains on the rapidly evolving global cybercrime threat landscape.

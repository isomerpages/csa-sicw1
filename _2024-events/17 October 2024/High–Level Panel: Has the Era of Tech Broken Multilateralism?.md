#### **High-Level Panel: Has the Era of Tech Broken Multilateralism?**

**17 October 2024 (Thursday)**  
*Time: 9.00am to 10.35am (GMT +8)*

**High-Level Panel: Has the Era of Tech Broken Multilateralism?**

Multilateralism has been the cornerstone of international cooperation. Historically, countries have come together to develop frameworks, convention and rules to address common issues facing the international community. Today, this same approach is taken to address challenges posed by new and rapidly evolving technologies, including developments in the digital and cyberspace. 

However, technologies have changed the way we interact and live. Is multilateralism still the appropriate and effective means to fostering global consensus on tackling digital and cyber issues? Given geopolitical tensions and rivalry, is multilateralism workable? In view of the complexity of issues facing us, do States and international organisations have the expertise and finesse to manage and respond to challenges to international security? What role can industry, academia and civil society play in helping to address these common security challenges? 

In this session, panellists will explore the impact of the technology era on multilateralism and the role of the UN in fostering global collaboration. They will discuss how nations can strengthen multilateralism to ensure that it is open and inclusive, where every country’s voice is heard and included.

**High-Level Panel: Advancing Rules, Norms, and Standards in Cyberspace: The Way Forward**

The digital realm has become an essential part of our interconnected world, but as cyberspace evolves, so too do the challenges it presents. The need for global rules, norms, and standards has never been more critical to ensuring an open, secure, safe, trusted and interoperable cyberspace. Yet, reaching consensus on what these frameworks should look like is fraught with complexities, as differing national interests and geopolitical rivalries come into play.

Can the international community come together to develop and uphold principles that promote peace and security in cyberspace? What role do multilateral institutions play in establishing these rules and ensuring that they are respected by all? How can these frameworks keep pace with rapidly advancing technology while ensuring that they reflect the needs and voices of all stakeholders?
This session will examine the path forward for advancing global rules, norms, and standards in cyberspace. Panellists will discuss the role of the UN in driving multilateral collaboration and how the international community can band together to build a resilient and trustworthy digital environment for the future.

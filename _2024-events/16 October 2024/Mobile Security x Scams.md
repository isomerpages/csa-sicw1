**International Cooperation: Working Together to Combat Scams**
<br>Over the last five years, the total number of scam cases in Singapore alone have increased fivefold, while losses to scams have more than quadrupled. Increasingly, most scams are carried out online by syndicates that operate across jurisdictions, and scams have become a serious transboundary issue. To tackle scams more effectively, countries must come together to share experiences and expertise, and to step up on international cooperation. This roundtable gathers government leaders from countries who have been proactive in combatting scams, to discuss the domestic policies and measures they have implemented and how countries can work together to protect their citizens.

**Forging New Pathways to Safeguard Mobile Devices from Scams Through Public-Private Partnerships**
<br>Mobile security is crucial in today’s digital age, as smartphones are integral to daily life. Cybercriminals increasingly target mobile devices with scams, such as phishing, malware and fraudulent apps. These attacks can lead to data breaches, privacy invasion, or even financial losses. In Singapore, combatting scams is a whole-of-society endeavour, and the government works in close partnership with industry to address the issues. This event will showcase recent efforts by industry players in tackling scams on mobile devices, highlighting the innovations that were developed to keep their users safe online.

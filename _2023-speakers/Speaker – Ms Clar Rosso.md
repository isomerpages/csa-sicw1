##### **Biography**
Clar Rosso, Certified in Cybersecurity, has more than two decades of experience helping global professional associations and certifying bodies grow and strengthen member value. As CEO of ISC2, she has established a forward-looking strategic framework and set bold goals for the future of the cybersecurity profession. 

Under Clar’s leadership, ISC2 has experienced record growth of its global community through the launch of several key initiatives. The association’s pledge of One Million Certified in Cybersecurity has provided a pathway for individuals to access foundational cybersecurity education, and a free opportunity to take the Certified in Cybersecurity exam. This addition to the ISC2 portfolio develops a pipeline to fill the cybersecurity workforce gap. Clar oversaw the creation of an Advocacy team that has strengthened – and raised – the global profile for ISC2 with key policy makers around the world. These efforts help ensure cybersecurity professionals are consulted and considered during the formation of cybersecurity policy, legislation, regulations and standards on the global stage. 

Under her direction, ISC2 established a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) with the goal of ensuring the cybersecurity profession better represents the diversity of the world it protects and that rewarding cybersecurity jobs are accessible to more people. 

Prior to joining ISC2, Clar served as the executive vice president, engagement and learning innovation for the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants (AICPA) where she led the development and execution of strategy to support global competency development and lifelong learning for the finance and accounting profession. 

Clar holds a bachelor’s degree in rhetoric and communications from the University of California, Davis and a master’s degree in special education from San Francisco State University. She also holds the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity certification.

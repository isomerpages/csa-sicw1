Organisations have accelerated their pace of digitalisation, and with a corresponding increase in attack surface, cybersecurity is a critical enabler for organisations. As organisations adopt cloud computing, it is important for them to have the know-how to operate in a secure cloud computing environment. Join us in this event to learn about the latest initiatives from the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) to help organisations stay “cyber safe” in the cloud. 

Given that cybersecurity is a collective responsibility, this event also recognises organisations partnering with CSA to enable a Safer Cyberspace for Enterprises and who have made contributions to CSA’s SG Cyber Safe programme.

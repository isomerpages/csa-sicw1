#### **2024 SICW Women In Cyber**

Creating and sustaining trust in our digital world calls for a comprehensive, ecosystem-wide collaboration. As cybersecurity threats become more sophisticated and impact our communities, tapping into the unique perspectives and talents across society is essential to strengthen our collective defenses. The SICW Women in Cyber event sought to promote cybersecurity as a career for female students and working professionals, and inspire those new to the field by highlighting the remarkable achievements of trailblazing women who are breaking barriers and inspiring others in the cybersecurity field. These women shared their personal journeys of overcoming challenges in a traditionally male-dominated field, explored their pioneering contributions to the industry, presented innovative solutions to cyber threats, and emphasised the importance of fostering diversity for a more secure future.

This year, participants were a part of lightning talks, a Q&amp;A segment, and networking opportunities.

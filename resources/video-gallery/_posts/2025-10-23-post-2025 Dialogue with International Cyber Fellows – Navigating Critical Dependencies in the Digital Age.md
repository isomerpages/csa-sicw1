#### **2025 Dialogue with International Cyber Fellows - Navigating Critical Dependencies in the Digital Age**

This alumnus gathering brought together alumnus from the Tallinn Cyber Diplomacy Summer School and United Nations-Singapore Cyber Fellowship for a substantial and interactive exchange of ideas. Leveraging the diverse experiences of its members, the event featured discussions designed to foster dialogue on current challenges and strategies related to the implementation of international cyber stability frameworks.

The scenario-based discussion centred around Navigating Critical Dependencies in the Digital age. In an era of increasing digital interconnectivity, organisations face heightened risk from critical dependencies, either related to supply chains, third-party vendors, critical infrastructure, and cross-border dependencies. A breach in any part of this web can have cascading effects. This alumnus event brought together cyber experts, diplomats and cybersecurity practitioners to explore a high-stakes, real-world inspired cyber incident through an interactive scenario.

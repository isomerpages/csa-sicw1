#### **SICW 2022 - SG Cyber Safe for Enterprises Dialogue &amp; Partner Appreciation**

Employees tend to be the weakest link in an organisation’s security, as attackers continually evolve and advance the sophistication of social engineering attacks. For this reason, the human factor remains a critical issue in creating a secure digital environment.

Join us in the SG Cyber Safe for Enterprises Dialogue to understand more about the human factor in your organisations and how you can take steps to address the weakness. 

The SG Cyber Safe Partner Appreciation aims to recognise partnering organisations, CSA’s appointed Cyber Essentials and Cyber Trust certification bodies, and other third-party advocates that have made outstanding contributions to the programme. Join us in the appreciation ceremony and celebrate their achievements!

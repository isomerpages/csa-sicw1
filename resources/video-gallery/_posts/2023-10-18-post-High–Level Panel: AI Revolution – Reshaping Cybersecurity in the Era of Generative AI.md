#### **2023 High-Level Panel: AI Revolution - Reshaping Cybersecurity in the Era of Generative AI**

The successive rollouts of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models by OpenAI, SenseTime and other tech giants in the past year represent a significant milestone in the development of AI. This is especially so with the iconic debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and China’s SenseChat, which amazed the world with its text and code generation prowess. Such cutting-edge technology is based on Foundation Models (FMs) trained on big data at scale, which can be adapted for a wide variety of tasks in different domains (e.g. improvisation and generation of content).
 
This is a major game changer for how we use such technology; while Generative AI helps to improve sense-making and decision-making for cyber defenders, it lowers the barrier of entry for attackers to generate exploits for cyber attacks. This session stimulated discussion on how stakeholders could collaborate to derive the benefits of using Generative AI and at the same time defend against threats arising from its use.

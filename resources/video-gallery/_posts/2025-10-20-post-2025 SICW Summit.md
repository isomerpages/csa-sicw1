#### **2025 SICW Summit**

As the digital domain becomes increasingly intertwined with global stability and economic growth, intensifying geopolitical competition, shifting dynamics in global governance, and the growing scale of cyber threats are collectively reshaping the digital and cyber landscape.

Beyond being a technical challenge, cybersecurity today is a strategic imperative that impacts international security, economic prosperity, and societal trust. The interconnected nature of cyberspace means that developments in one part of the world can have far-reaching consequences elsewhere, underscoring the urgency of building common ground and sharing responsibility to safeguard the digital future.

Against the backdrop of uncertainty and rapid change, SICW explored the impact of cyber developments on international security and the digital economy. It focused on the shifting global environment and reaffirmed the vital role of having an inclusive dialogue in shaping the next era of global cybersecurity.

The SICW Summit by-invitation only gala dinner kicked off the 10th Singapore International Cyber Week. It inaugurated discussions in the days to follow around this year’s SICW theme of “Shaping the Next Era of Global Cybersecurity”. International heads of country delegations, top senior officials, industry leaders and key cybersecurity personalities attended the event.

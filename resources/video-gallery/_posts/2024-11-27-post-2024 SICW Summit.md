#### **2024 SICW Summit**

Trust and Security in the Digital Era

We live in a Digital Era predicated on trust. Trust is vital for States to cooperate, connect and exchange information and data with each other. Trust is also critical for Government, citizens and industry to interact, and organise our social, political and economic way of life, supported by digital platforms and systems. Without trust, people, governments and businesses would not be able to reap the social and economic benefits of digitalisation.

Today, the increasingly fragmented digital and cyber landscape fraught with ongoing conflicts, geopolitical and economic contestations, and supply chain vulnerabilities threatens to erode and undermine the digital trust that is essential for international stability and societies to flourish. Politically, the lack of trust and of security in the digital space affects our democratic processes in what is now being termed as a ‘global election year’.

The SICW Summit by-invitation only gala dinner kicked off the 9th Singapore International Cyber Week. It inaugurated discussions in the days to follow around this year’s SICW theme of “Trust and Security in the Digital Era”. International heads of country delegations, top senior officials, industry leaders and key cybersecurity personalities attended the event.

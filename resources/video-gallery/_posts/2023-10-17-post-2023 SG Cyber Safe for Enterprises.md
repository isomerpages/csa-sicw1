#### **SG Cyber Safe for Enterprises**

Organisations have accelerated their pace of digitalisation, and with a corresponding increase in attack surface, cybersecurity is a critical enabler for organisations. As organisations adopt cloud computing, it is important for them to have the know-how to operate in a secure cloud computing environment. This event explored the latest initiatives from the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) to help organisations stay “cyber safe” in the cloud.&nbsp;

Given that cybersecurity is a collective responsibility, this event also recognised organisations partnering with CSA to enable a Safer Cyberspace for Enterprises, and those who had made contributions to CSA’s SG Cyber Safe programme.

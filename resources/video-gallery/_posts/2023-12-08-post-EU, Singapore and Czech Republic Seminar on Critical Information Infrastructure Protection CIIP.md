#### **EU, Singapore and Czech Republic Seminar on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection CIIP**

The European Union has long been striving to find ways to provide better protection and increased resilience from cyber-attacks, as well as to promote stability in cyberspace, at national, regional and multilateral levels. Implementation of the norms of responsible state behaviour is one of them. Enhanced resilience and promoting stability require a global solution since it is a global problem and a shared responsibility. The Czech Republic is also committed to strengthen cyber security at the multilateral level.&nbsp;

The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Czech National Cyber and Information Security Agency (NÃšKIB) and ESIWA organised this seminar on this topic on the side-lines of the Singapore International Cyber Week - to exchange views on the implementation of the norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and protection of Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) with a specific focus on vulnerabilities. The seminar focused on Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP), which is the target of a large number of cyber-attacks globally.

#### **2024 Securing Smart Cities**

Securing Smart Cities aimed to promote collaboration, sharing of real-world case studies, discussing unique cyber-physical issues, as well as providing insights into the role of government policies and regulations to ensure the safety, security and privacy of the citizens living in an ever-growing connected space. Smart cities integrate various technologies to enhance urban living, but this integration also increases the attack surface and allows exploitation of vulnerabilities by cyber threat actors.

This event invited government agencies, industry &amp; technology leaders, and other cybersecurity ecosystem partners to explore the challenges and solutions that better protect systems deployment in the Smart City space.

This yearâ€™s main focus was on the emergence of Cyber-Physical Risks, with a panel discussion to explore how governments and industry leaders could work together to effectively identify and tackle these issues, whilst striking a balance between usability, cost, and security.

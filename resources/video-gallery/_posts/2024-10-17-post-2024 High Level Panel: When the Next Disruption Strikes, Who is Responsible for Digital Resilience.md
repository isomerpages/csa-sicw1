#### **2024 High Level Panel: When the Next Disruption Strikes, Who is Responsible for Digital Resilience**

Large-scale digital disruptions that occur instantaneously with no advance warning can often erode public confidence in the digital domain, threatening to stall the progress and undermine the potential of digitalisation. Given the complex and interconnected nature of the digital ecosystem, such disruptions are bound to happen, and are perhaps even unavoidable. It is not a question of if, but when the next disruption could occur, and the ability to recover quickly and effectively from a disruption is key.

Without resilience, it becomes difficult to have trust in our digital ecosystem. Digitalisation will inevitably falter if people start doubting or even avoiding digital technologies. Ensuring a resilient and trusted digital environment is not just a technical challenge, and questions remain over who is responsible for digital resilience and how different stakeholders work together.

This session discussed the strategic and policy implications of resilience in the digital domain, and the possible next steps taken to strengthen resilience in the digital domain. The panel of government experts and industry leaders discussed the roles and responsibilities of the public and private sectors in strengthening resilience in the digital domain, and how public-private partnerships could contribute to this important effort.

#### **2023 High-Level Panel: Securing the Future – Public-Private Partnership for Cyber Resilience**

In 2020, the SolarWinds hack demonstrated that a breach of a single company could trigger a significantly larger supply chain incident, impacting thousands of organizations, including government systems. As our interconnectivity deepens, it has become increasingly evident to both the public and private sectors that ensuring security in the shared digital space necessitates collaborative efforts.  

In the pursuit of national cyber resilience, governments are progressively exploring cybersecurity strategies that prioritize collaboration and information sharing between the public and private sectors to address this challenge. Amidst an environment marked by the escalating scale and sophistication of cyber threats, fostering public-private partnership has taken on a greater urgency. Establishing these partnerships requires a foundation of trust. Each partner must jointly shoulder the responsibility for a secure digital future and actively contribute to its realization. 

This session critically examined the approaches to public-private partnerships and delved into the strategies that had achieved success.

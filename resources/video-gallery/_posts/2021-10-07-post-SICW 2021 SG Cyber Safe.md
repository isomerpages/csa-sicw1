#### **SICW 2021 - Launch of SG Cyber Safe Partnership Programme & SG Cyber Safe for Enterprises Panel Discussion**

While the Government takes a key role in leading cybersecurity efforts, cybersecurity is also everyoneâ€™s business and thus, a collective responsibility. For this reason, CSA works closely with industry to co-develop cybersecurity content or products that complement our efforts to drive cybersecurity awareness and adoption.

The SG Cyber Safe Partnership Programme encourages industry to partner with CSA to raise the cybersecurity posture of local businesses, individuals and the community.

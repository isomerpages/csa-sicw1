#### **2025 Deep Truth: Unmasking Digital Deception**

As AI-generated content becomes increasingly sophisticated, the risk is that information threats will become all the more convincing, and pose a greater threat to societal trust and national security.
CSA’s Distinguished Engineer &amp; Senior Director (Special Projects) Stanley Tsang shared his insights on emerging AI-enabled threats, followed by an exclusive demonstration of cutting-edge deepfake detection technology by the Centre for Advanced Technologies in Online Safety (CATOS). The session highlighted how policymakers can approach AI-enabled threats and included a live demonstration of technologies from the first version of CATOS’ Online Trust and Safety (OTS) Toolkit.

The demonstration began with Dr. Yang Yinping, Centre Director of CATOS who outlined the centre’s focal areas in tackling harmful online content and how deep tech and translational research are driving solutions in collaboration with public agencies, universities, and industry partners.

Afterwards, Dr. Wang Yunlong  showcased the increasing accessibility of deepfake generation tools, underscoring the urgency of addressing synthetic media threats.

Dr. Soumik Modal then presented advanced capabilities in visual and audio deepfake detection, along with an automatic fact-checking solution to tackle deceptive synthetic media and non-factual claims.

Finally, Ms. Therese Quieta demonstrated the use of content authenticity technologies, including the implementation of C2PA, to prevent misinformation, and provide transparent provenance in digital media.

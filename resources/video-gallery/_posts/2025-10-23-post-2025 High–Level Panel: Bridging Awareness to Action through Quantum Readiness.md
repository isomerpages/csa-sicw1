#### **2025 High-Level Panel: Securing Tomorrow, Today – Bridging Awareness to Action through Quantum Readiness**

As quantum computing rapidly advances, the conversation around quantum readiness has shifted from awareness to action. Nations, industries, and technology leaders need to plan ahead to embed quantum resilience at the foundation and design of digital systems. This year’s High-Level Panel on “Securing Tomorrow, Today — Bridging Awareness to Action through Quantum Readiness” highlighted the impetus to respond to the growing quantum threat without delay. As quantum computers edge closer to practical capabilities, systems relying on classical cryptography can become vulnerable, endangering the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital systems worldwide. This High-Level Panel brought together global leaders to chart a pragmatic and collaborative approach towards quantum readiness and safety.

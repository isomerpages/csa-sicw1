#### **2025 Women in Cyber: Ask-Me-Anything &amp; Workforce Development Panel**

**Women in Cyber: Ask-Me-Anything**
<br>The cybersecurity industry continues to face talent shortage and a low female participation rate. We encourage more women and girls to consider cybersecurity as a career.

This year’s SICW Women in Cyber event featured an Ask Me Anything session, bringing together accomplished women from government and industry for an open, candid exchange with the audience.

Participants heard personal stories and gained first-hand insights from experts working across a variety of roles — from industry practitioners and leaders to policymakers. Speakers shared how they navigated challenges, built expertise, and earned trust in this traditionally male-dominated field.

This interactive format ensured attendees left with practical tips, fresh perspectives, and the confidence to chart their own path in cybersecurity.

Whether you are a student, early-career professional, or considering a mid-career switch, this session offered a unique opportunity to learn directly from those shaping the next chapter of the cyber landscape.

**Workforce Development Panel**
<br>Talent attraction and development are a key success factor for a country’s cybersecurity strategy. Many countries share the desire to develop high-quality cybersecurity workforces which are capable to defend against global cyber threats that are growing in scale and sophistication.

For the first time at SICW, we gathered a panel that featured government leaders from the International Coalition of Cyber Security Workforces (ICCSW) to share insights and strategies for developing world-class cybersecurity workforces.

The conversation cast a spotlight on the vital roles of governments, industry, training and certification bodies, and professionals in uplifting skills, strengthening professional standards, and keeping pace with fast-evolving threats. The panel also highlighted the importance of international collaboration and explore opportunities for cross-border talent development and mutual recognition of competencies.

Additionally, presentations on ongoing international cross-recognition efforts such as the UK-SG Body of Knowledge Mapping project and harmonisation of cybersecurity roles across jurisdictions will be conducted by representatives from academia and industry.

Whether you are an employer, service provider, policymaker, or cybersecurity professional, this session offers fresh perspectives, practical approaches, and opportunities to connect with peers committed to raising the quality of the cybersecurity workforce.

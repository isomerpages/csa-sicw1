#### **Seventh Edition of Singapore International Cyber Week Concludes Successfully with International and Regional Partners Committed to Strengthening Cybersecurity Cooperation**

The seventh edition of the Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW) was held on 18 - 20 Oct 2022 with more than 10,000 local and international delegates participating in the hybrid event. Among the global leaders and industry experts who spoke were Alejandro Mayorkas, the United States’ Secretary of the Department of the Homeland Security; Izumi Nakamitsu, the United Nations’ Under-Secretary-General and High Representative for Disarmament Affairs; Lim Jock Hoi, ASEAN’s Secretary-General; Wang Lei, Coordinator for Cyber Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China; Michaela Browning, Vice President, Government Affairs and Public Policy, Google Asia Pacific; and Lee Fook Sun, Chairman, Ensign InfoSecurity.

With over 200 speakers covering a myriad of topics ranging from technology to operations to policy, SICW 2022 attracted a diverse audience mix of government officials, industry experts, academics and cybersecurity professionals.

**Cybersecurity is a Team Effort, Multi-Stakeholder Partnerships Key to Success**

The message of global cooperation was emphasised by multiple speakers throughout the event. In her address at the opening ceremony, Minister for Communications and Information (MCI) Josephine Teo said that against the challenging backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions and an evolving cyber threat landscape, a strong global cybersecurity architecture helmed by a multi-stakeholder approach is needed to address the challenges.

“A multi-stakeholder approach is key because cybersecurity is a team effort. Governments cannot do it alone. Therefore, partnerships among stakeholders – governments, industry, academia – are needed… We also believe that this approach helps to minimise the spill-over of geopolitical tensions into the digital domain by keeping open channels of communications, and building shared expectations and norms on behaviour,” she said.

Australia’s Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs Tim Watts said that with the threat of ransomware becoming “ubiquitous in the developed world,” digitalisation for economic development meant that developing countries have become targets of ransomware actors and that combatting the “shared threat of ransom” has to be a “shared responsibility”.

H.E Nathalie Jaarsma, Ambassador at-Large for Security Policy and Cyber, The Kingdom of the Netherlands, added that it is “beneficial to study the threats landscape together.”

Minister Teo also updated on plans for the ASEAN Regional Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT] <a href="https://www.csa.gov.sg/News-Events/Press-Releases/2022/establishment-of-asean-regional-computer-emergency-response-team" target="blank"></a> at the ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity. The ASEAN CERT will strengthen ASEAN’s overall cybersecurity posture and operational readiness in dealing with the fast-evolving cyber landscape by enabling stronger regional cybersecurity incident response coordination.

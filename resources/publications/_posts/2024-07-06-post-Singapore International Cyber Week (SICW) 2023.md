**Building Trust and Security in the Digital Domain**

In his opening address at the SICW Summit, Mr Teo Chee Hean, Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security, Singapore, emphasised the necessity of building trust and security in the emerging digital order. He said that as the digital domain is constantly evolving, and as the world is still trying to figure out what the rules and norms should be, trust is fundamental, not just between states, but between governments and the tech industry, and the public’s trust in the digital world.

An example of building trust between states was given in the speech by Ms Anne Neuberger, the Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technologies at the White House. She welcomed all countries to join the international Counter Ransomware Initiative, which has grown to 50 countries and is the world’s largest cyber partnership, to work together to fight ransomware. 

At the ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cyber Security, which is part of SICW, Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity, spoke about strengthening cybersecurity cooperation and resilience regionally, as well as establishing a rules-based multilateral order in cyberspace internationally.

Mr Luong Tam Quang, Deputy Minister of Public Security Senior Lieutenant General, Vietnam, called on ASEAN countries to intensify effective implementation of cooperation on cybersecurity, build common intra-bloc as well as international regulations on cyber security, and establish a mechanism to support ASEAN member states in responding to and handling cyber security matters and preventing cyber attacks, among others.

At the International Internet-of-Things (IoT) Security Roundtable, Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State (SMS) for Communications and Information announced that Singapore is actively working with other nations to develop an international standard, the ISO 27404, to harmonise security efforts and facilitate mutual recognition of cybersecurity labelling schemes, ensuring global cooperation in enhancing IoT security.

Singapore and the United Kingdom also expressed their intention to jointly build and develop a cyber security profession that is clearly-defined and future-proofed. Both countries agreed to cooperate on several matters, such as building and aligning a common knowledge base in cybersecurity, mapping knowledge and skills required to areas of practice in cybersecurity, and exploring a cyber skills dialogue. 

To help members of the public make more informed choices in the products they buy, SMS Dr Janil Puthucheary updated that CSA will be working closely with the industry to develop a Cybersecurity Implementation Toolkit that manufacturers can use to build devices that are secure-by-design. This will help more manufacturers successfully achieve a label under the Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme. He also announced the launch of the Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme for Medical Devices [CLS(MD)] sandbox, where medical device manufacturers are invited to participate in the sandbox to have a first-mover advantage in enhancing the security of their products. 

To educate the public on ransomware and provide recovery support, the Singapore Police Force and CSA announced the launch of a ransomware portal, a one-stop platform for organisations to access key ransomware-related resources on global trends and emerging ransomware variants. The portal also provides victims of ransomware attacks with known decryption keys and incident response checklists.

**Building Trust between Governments and Tech Titans**

In the era of Big Tech, it is imperative that public-private partnerships work together to develop win-win solutions that safeguard and expand the public good. To that end, Mr Heng Swee Keat, Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) and Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies, Singapore, announced that the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) will be establishing separate partnerships with Microsoft and Google, to address cybersecurity threats and enhance our national cyber defence. This will help to realise synergies and pave the way towards a digital domain that is secure, trusted, and inclusive.

In another example of partnerships between the Singapore Government and the tech industry, Mr Tan Kiat How, Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and for National Development announced the release of the Cloud Security Companion Guides. These guides, developed in close partnership with major cloud service providers in Singapore – Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft – will help cloud customers to better understand cloud-specific risks and responsibilities, as well as the necessary steps to take.

**Investing in Cybersecurity Capacity and Talent Development**

SICW 2023 saw Singapore continue to build up its cybersecurity capacity capabilities. DPM Heng announced the launch of the SG Cyber Leadership and Alumni Programme, a structured programme to cater to participants at different stages of their cybersecurity journey. To support this new programme, Singapore’s earlier funding commitment of $30 million for cyber capacity building will be extended by another three years to 2026. 

Minister Josephine Teo, also launched the SG Cyber Associates, a new programme under the talent pillar of its Cybersecurity Talent, Innovation and Growth (Cyber TIG) Plan. This programme provides foundational and targeted cybersecurity training for non-cybersecurity professionals to develop cybersecurity skills relevant to their work. ISC2 will offer 10,000 training places under their One Million Certified in Cybersecurity programme, while the Institution of Engineers Singapore will deliver short cybersecurity courses on targeted technology domains for engineers.

In the years to come, SICW will continue to be a leading global event to enable a safer cyberspace for all, develop a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem, and enhance international cyber cooperation. As Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean summed up, “the challenge of building and maintaining trust in the digital domain is complex, but it is imperative that we collectively achieve a better understanding of each other’s perspectives, recognise our shared interests in cyberspace, and work towards building the trust we need for a digital world and a better future.”

Mr Jeff Moss, Founder of Black Hat and DEF CON, Commissioner of Global Council on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC), spoke at the SICW Conversations (Technology). Hosted by Mr Gaurav Keerthi, CSA’s Deputy Chief Executive (Development), the session saw the exchange of views on how the public and private sectors can work together to combat the spread of ransomware and prevent the growth of the ransomware industry.

Both discussed measures such as upstream technological intervention or implementing new regulations that would steer cryptocurrency exchanges towards greater transparency. Ransomware is a global issue, and not just a problem that the industry or even a nation state can solve alone. It requires global solutions, with collaboration among international partners, as key to overcoming the ransomware threat.

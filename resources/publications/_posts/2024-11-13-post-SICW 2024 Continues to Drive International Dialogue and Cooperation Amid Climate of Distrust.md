#### **SICW 2024 Continues to Drive International Dialogue and Cooperation Amid Climate of Distrust**

The ninth edition of the Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW) 2024 will once again bring together top global policymakers, thought leaders and cybersecurity experts to advance cooperation and knowledge exchange on key cybersecurity issues and solutions. About 12,000 delegates from more than 80 countries are expected to attend the event. 

2. The theme for SICW 2024 – “Trust and Security in the Digital Era”, was chosen with the intent to drive critical conversations and partnerships to foster trust and enhance security in the digital and cyber domain. Held from 14 to 17 October 2024, events under the SICW umbrella include the ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity (AMCC) and GovernmentWare (GovWare) Exhibition and Conference. SICW 2024 will be opened by Guest-of-Honour, Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security, Mr Teo Chee Hean. 

3.     The SICW takes place amid a growing geopolitical climate of distrust, proliferated by the politicisation of technology, intensified China-US rivalry, ongoing crises such as the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts, and increasing distrust in governments1 driven and exploited by rapid advances in technology. This distrust has paralysed dialogue in many international platforms.

4.     In spite of the prevailing geopolitical tensions, the SICW continues to be a key international and regional platform in the global cyber conference calendar bringing together countries with diverse, and even opposing, perspectives on current digital and cyber issues of policy, technical, and diplomatic interest and relevance to be heard and discussed openly. This year, the SICW will continue to see high-level Ministerial and senior level participation from countries across the world including ASEAN Member States, Brazil, China, European Union, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and the United States. High level discussion at the SICW will centre around four High-Level Opening Plenary panel discussions on critical topics such as tech regulation, global digital governance and securing trust in the digital era and election security featuring speakers and panellists from China, Indonesia, Qatar, Russia, United Kingdom, and the United States among others. 

5.     SICW 2024 will explore beyond traditional cybersecurity issues relating to critical information infrastructure protection and resilience, to discuss topics such as election security, regulation of big technology companies and the possibility of establishing a meaningful interoperable framework for digital rules and standards to foster international operation even in the middle of geopolitical contestation. SICW will also discuss the effect of newer digital technologies on matters of diplomacy, peace, and security.  

6.     Another attraction of SICW is that is the value of bringing together ASEAN Member States and Dialogue Partners to identify avenues for deeper cooperation in support of the stronger regional cybersecurity architecture.  It was at AMCC that ASEAN Member States came together to advance regional cooperation in cybersecurity and subsequently became the first and only regional grouping that has adopted UN norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Additionally, SICW has become a platform for ASEAN Member States to engage with a wide variety of Dialogue Partners, including countries such as Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States. The Malaysia’s first Minister of Digital YB Mr Tuan Gobind Singh Deo will be presenting a keynote and join a fireside chat at the SICW Summit. With the impending Malaysian chairmanship of ASEAN in 2025, his speech is expected to reflect the region’s priorities in the highly contested digital and cyber space.

7.     SICW attendees can also expect to hear thought-provoking discussions and view innovative showcases from over 300 exhibitors at the GovWare Exhibition and Conference, which is now into its 31st year. Attendees can look forward to discussions on topics such as the governance and security of AI and cybersecurity in the age of digital innovation.

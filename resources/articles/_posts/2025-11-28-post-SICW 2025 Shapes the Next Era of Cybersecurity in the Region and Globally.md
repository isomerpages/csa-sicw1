#### **SICW 2025 Continues the Work on the Local and International Front to Shape the Next Era of Global Cybersecurity Amid Emerging threats**

The 10th edition of the Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW 2025) once again demonstrated its role as a premier global platform for facilitating conversations on cybersecurity, bringing together over 14,000 delegates from over 90 countries and regions, along with more than 300 exhibitors. Held from 21 to 23 October 2025, the event provided a platform for policymakers, industry leaders, cybersecurity experts, and academia to engage in critical discussions about the future of cybersecurity in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. The theme for SICW 2025, “Shaping the Next Era of Global Cybersecurity,” emphasised the need for global cooperation, trust-building, and a shared commitment to securing the digital future.

**International Collaboration**

SICW 2025 spotlighted several initiatives that reflect Singapore’s commitment to cyber capacity-building. Mr K Shanmugam, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs, <a href="https://www.csa.gov.sg/news-events/press-releases/un-singapore-cyber-programme--unscp--extended-for-three-years-to-equip-un-member-states/" target="blank">announced the renewal of the UN-Singapore Cyber Programme (UNSCP) for another three years</a>, which continues to support UN Member States to better understand and address cybersecurity threats through two key initiatives — the UN-Singapore Cyber Fellowship and the Cyber Diplomacy E-learning Course on the UNODA Disarmament Education Dashboard.

Additionally, the ASEAN-Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence (ASCCE) continues to play a crucial role in strengthening ASEAN's cyber resilience. Minister Josephine Teo, Minister for Digital Development and Information, <a href="https://www.csa.gov.sg/news-events/speeches/opening-remarks-by-minister-josephine-teo-at-asean-ministerial-conference-on-22-oct-2025/" target="blank">highlighted that ASEAN has made significant strides over the past decade</a>, including the adoption of the UN’s 11 norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. The SG Cyber Leadership Programme will be extended to Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) member states, with the inaugural workshop taking place in December 2025. ASCCE will also continue to collaborate with industry partners, including Microsoft, to advance cybersecurity through the ASCCE-Microsoft Roundtable, which focuses on emerging threats, particularly AI and online scams.

**Efforts to Bolster Cybersecurity in Singapore**

To help provide central support for enterprises, <a href="https://www.csa.gov.sg/news-events/press-releases/plans-for-establishment-of-cyber-resilience-centre-to-provide-support-to-organisations/" target="blank">the Cyber Resilience Centre (CRC), operated by the Singapore Business Federation, will open in 2026</a>. It will provide cybersecurity health clinics, incident helplines, cyber drills and access to CSA’s CISO-as-a-Service initiative, granting SMEs the support and resources to raise their cybersecurity posture as they embrace new technologies.

In addition, to support system owners manage emerging risks from advanced technologies, CSA announced new and refreshed guidelines. <a href="https://www.csa.gov.sg/news-events/press-releases/csa-releases-an-addendum-to-support-system-owners-in-securing-agentic-ai-system/" target="blank">The Addendum to the Companion Guide on Securing Agentic AI was released for public consultation</a>. The Addendum provides practical guidance for system owners to adopt AI in a safe and secure manner. The consultation will run till the end of this year. To address the quantum threat, <a href="https://www.csa.gov.sg/news-events/press-releases/csa-releases-a-quantum-safe-handbook-and-quantum-readiness-index/" target="blank">the Quantum-Safe Handbook and Quantum Readiness Index were released</a> for CII owners and government agencies to prepare for quantum-safe transition and gauge their organisations’ state of readiness to make more informed business decisions. 

With the inclusion of technologies in our everyday lives, there is a need to raise the security baseline of mobile applications. Hence, <a href="http://csa.gov.sg/news-events/press-releases/csa-unveils-safe-app-portal-pilot/" target="blank">CSA launched the Safe App Portal Pilot</a>, enabling developers, including smaller teams, to identify security gaps and weaknesses through app scans, safety ratings and an app report identifying critical risks. <a target="blank">CSA also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the App Defense Alliance</a>, led by Google, Meta and Microsoft, to collaborate and strengthen mobile app security through the exchanging of best practices, technical knowledge exchange on app testing methodologies, and aligning global standards. 

**Conclusion** 

The event has reaffirmed Singapore’s role as a global cybersecurity leader. Minister Josephine Teo reflected on SICW’s growth over the past decade, emphasising that the trust and partnerships built through SICW have been key to its success. Looking ahead, Minister Josephine Teo expressed that she is confident that the SICW will continue to drive forward global collaboration and cybersecurity innovation, ensuring a safe and secure digital future for all. The SICW will be held from 12 to 15 October 2026 next year.

#### **High-Level Panel: Can AI be Secure?**

**16 October 2024 (Wednesday)**  
*Time: 9.30am-11.00am (GMT +8)*

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being adopted at an increasingly rapid pace, including in critical infrastructure. To ensure that AI outcomes are trustworthy and meet organisations’ objectives, there is an urgent need to address the security risks involved. 

This panel brings together international experts from governments and industry to explore how to approach the security of AI systems, both as part of AI governance and other traditional cybersecurity practices, and discuss how stakeholders should work together to safeguard the development, deployment and use of AI.

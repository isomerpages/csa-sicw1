Sweden, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE) and Microsoft cordially invite you to join our consultation held during the SICW on: Mainstreaming cybersecurity in digital transformation and development in the context of Southeast Asia. The achievement of sustainable development is intrinsically linked to the effective utilization of digital transformation, whether through the digital transformation of countries, or the use of digital technologies in development work. However, digital technologies can only support sustainable development if they are also trustworthy and secure, building more resilient societies. Understanding the challenges that the development community is faced with in terms of integrating cybersecurity principles and practices into their interventions is key in bridging the current gap between the development community and cybersecurity. 

During this interactive workshop, the primary focus will be on four key aspects: firstly, identifying the various actors engaged in development and digital transformation processes. Secondly, pinpointing vulnerabilities in areas where development work lacks cybersecurity support will be a central concern. Thirdly, the workshop will delve into the customization of cybersecurity practices to align with the specific needs of local contexts. Lastly, it will explore the strategic utilization of partnerships to effectively integrate cybersecurity into broader development objectives. This workshop is organized as part of a broader project to develop a compendium aiming to mainstream cybersecurity into digital development.
